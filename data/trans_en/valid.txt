and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to preserve when we say , &quot; save the ocean . heal the ocean . &quot;
now , a dolphin , mother dolphin , any dolphin -- there &apos;s only one way that a pcb can get out of a dolphin .
that &apos;s a tragedy for those populations , but it &apos;s also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don &apos;t know that that &apos;s toxic meat .
these are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio , which includes the genus that has cholera in it .
copepods are small crustaceans .
in 1931 , she produced california &apos;s first community-based marine protected area , right next to the biggest polluting cannery , because julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone , the ocean needed a place to grow from , that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed , and she wanted to provide that seed .
and in a way that &apos;s a metaphor for life .
a play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the national theatre in london .
the choreographer , toby sedgwick , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse , which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs , grew up into the big horse .
the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .
the guys inside the horse have to be able to see out .
so , we have this ability as well .
we &apos;re living in a culture of jet lag , global travel , 24-hour business , shift work .
this is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time .
take a look at changing the present , started by a tedster , next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present .
so we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return , the good that can be driven could be astonishing .
but we have a problem .
and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .
a young factory worker who works night shifts , who manages to sneak away from the factory floor , where there is cctv by the way , and find a corner , where at 11 o &apos;clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight .
if you were in management , oh , that was a different story .
now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas .
you were tired , but you felt you could drive a few more miles .
it &apos;s another one of those categories where maybe there &apos;s not a lot of competition .
now , clearly we &apos;re not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
so watch as john does this here .
chris gerdes : the future race car -- 150mph , and no driver
all that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water , also helps cool our cities .
the water is turned into goo .
and when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs , you &apos;re left with unemployed people , and those people aren &apos;t cheap .
this can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can &apos;t meet the year-round demand for produce .
hometown security means creating wealth here at home , instead of destroying it overseas .
i spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment , that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it , actually left people in the same , if not worse , position that they were in before .
it is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility .
and when she said it , it made me anxious .
those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence .
but acceptance is something that takes time .
i &apos;m going to quote from another magazine of the &apos; 60s .
but speaking for myself -- well , i would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born that i could come to such a point -- speaking for myself , it &apos;s made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more purposeful in my whole life , that speaking for myself , i wouldn &apos;t give it up for anything in the world . &quot;
and on sunday night , we were all exhausted .
i thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child i had seen , a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect .
and yet , i knew from the work i had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for , that those would ultimately be his identity , and if they were his identity they would become my identity , that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded .
and he said &quot; if you go to mit , &quot; to which i had been given early admission , &quot; i will pay for every year you &apos;re at mit , in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want -- i will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in paris . &quot;
those are conveyor belts that go around .
and these kids had their laptops . but it was really what spirited this , plus the influence of joe and others . we started one laptop per child .
and then , i could tell you lots about the laptop , but i decided on just four things .
if you &apos;re in the jungle , it &apos;s about 500 meters . so if a kid bicycles home , or walks a few miles , they &apos;re going to be off the grid , so to speak .
not something you &apos;d envy or want to do .
i want you do something else .
nicholas negroponte talks about how one laptop per child is doing , two years in . speaking at the eg conference while the first xo laptops roll off the production line , he recaps the controversies and recommits to the goals of this far-reaching project .
but the first few systems were these leaky , loud power-guzzlers that martha stewart would definitely never have approved .
so she expresses here what it &apos;s like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea , built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing .
so i just call it the self-imposed , self-destructive arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem .
but that system has tons of problems .
everyone hates that equally , but republicans and democrats hate that together .
we get to hate each other on gun control and abortion and the environment , but on these fiscal issues , these important fiscal issues , we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say .
then you can see radical partisan change .
thank you .
and then somebody , i think it was bmw , introduced a light that went out slowly .
and when that happens , are you sitting there going , &quot; no , the movie &apos;s about to start , &quot; or are you going , &quot; that &apos;s fantastic . i &apos;m looking forward to it .
is it beautiful ? is it exciting ?
it &apos;s not a &quot; this is wonderful ! &quot;
well it obviously isn &apos;t .
i mean , if i just go through some of them now -- i know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects , and that does it consummately well , you can see it can .
there &apos;s so little compromise on this , you can &apos;t see it .
this is pretty close to intrinsic beauty . this one , as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this .
tell me something , did you think it was quick when you first saw it ? yes you did .
it feels fantastic when you do it , you look forward to doing it , and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have -- you look really smart .
well it starts from a very basic premise : of course , there &apos;s no god .
now education is a field the secular world really believes in .
all religions , all major religions , at various points call us children .
so get on your knees and repeat it . &quot;
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings .
the other thing that religions know is we &apos;re not just brains , we are also bodies .
that &apos;s why a very common feeling when you &apos;re in a museum -- let &apos;s admit it -- is , &quot; i don &apos;t know what this is about . &quot;
art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
so religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind .
incoming missiles from north oxford at any moment .
are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where , instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war , that there could be bridging ?
i had bought a copy of this book , &quot; the universe and dr. einstein &quot; -- a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in seattle .
and today , you would see this inside the mine , half a mile underground .
they have to drill holes in the ice , dive down into the water -- cold , cold water -- to get hold of the instrument , bring it up , do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do , put it back and get out before the ice melts .
an extraordinary set of telescopes .
so you &apos;re using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of 40 km .
radio : okay , release the balloon , release the balloon , release the balloon .
i &apos;m a librarian , and what i &apos;m trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it .
do you actually want it online ?
in india , they &apos;ve got another couple bookmobiles running around .
and we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it , and it turns out that 200 dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good .
if we can have mars rovers , you &apos;d think you could turn pages .
now we &apos;re scanning about 15,000 books a month , and it &apos;s starting to gear up another factor of two from there .
in the united states , it doesn &apos;t cost you to give something away . right ?
it &apos;s sort of the biggest tivo box you &apos;ve ever seen .
if there &apos;s one thing that we want to learn from the library of alexandria version one , which is probably best known for burning , is , don &apos;t just have one copy .
but before i show you what &apos;s inside , i will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredible things for you .
it looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty .
most of you are familiar with portobello mushrooms .
we exhale carbon dioxide , so does mycelium .
it &apos;s possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids , and many other acids and enzymes , pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals and forming calcium oxalates .
the largest organism in the world is in eastern oregon .
the last image we don &apos;t have .
we submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water , and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites .
and so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house .
i want to reinvent the delivery system , and the use of cardboard around the world , so they become ecological footprints .
and the wonderful thing about that is that i get to compare biospheres .
but by 1991 we finally had this thing built .
and those sweet potatoes became part of me .
and everybody outside thought we were dying .
and we proved the concept , more or less .
and one of the things we did was try to figure out : how small can you make these biospheres , and what can you do with them ?
kyoto protocol system .
it &apos;s a certain type of aesthetic .
maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here .
it was a time when medicine was cheap and very ineffective .
but what does it take ?
when you go from a world where you treated arthritis with aspirin , that mostly didn &apos;t do the job , to one where , if it gets bad enough , we can do a hip replacement , a knee replacement that gives you years , maybe decades , without disability , a dramatic change , well is it any surprise that that $ 40,000 hip replacement replacing the 10-cent aspirin is more expensive ?
one of my colleagues is a surgeon in cedar rapids , iowa , and he got interested in the question of , well how many ct scans did they do for their community in cedar rapids ?
could we design a checklist for surgery ?
there &apos;s a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we &apos;re not a system , forces us to behave with a different set of values .
now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
it comes in the mail ; it can come from australia or hawaii or florida , and you can introduce that queen .
and a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees , and that being bad , but we &apos;ve done that for thousands of years .
they get paid by pollen and nectar , to move that male sperm , the pollen , from flower to flower .
and so , in fact , if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees , you know that your environment is healthy , because they &apos;re top-of-the-food-chain bees .
and so it &apos;s incredible the amount of resources we &apos;ve spent keeping our lawns , which are these useless biosystems .
dennis vanengelsdorp : a plea for bees
i would love to , but why ?
well actually , you are going to whistle along .
okay .
it &apos;s a nice description because it &apos;s starting from left -- you have the stones -- immediately after the stones , the plants that are just able to live .
it &apos;s called the vegetative soul , because they lack movement , and so they don &apos;t need to sense .
and so if you need to study this sleeping problem , it &apos;s easy to study on plants , for example , than in animals and it &apos;s much more easy even ethically .
so you can recognize this kind of movement , the same movement that worms , snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display .
we have the animaloid -- and the normal robots inspired by animals , insectoid , so on .
she doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
and i love that moment in this video , because before it became a shared experience , it was something that was maybe a little bit scary , or something that was at least confusing to her .
after about 15 seconds , her friend appeared -- she had been hiding behind a display -- and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away .
so i wrote this high school kid back immediately , and i said , &quot; yes , you are correct .
that &apos;s a cop wearing black right there , being filmed with a hidden camera .
and you know , not everybody &apos;s going to like everything you do , and i &apos;ve certainly developed a thick skin thanks to internet comments , but that one &apos;s always bothered me , because we don &apos;t have too much time on our hands .
right now , if you want to test water in the field , you need a trained technician , expensive equipment like this , and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results .
thank you .
now why am i talking about cows ?
i &apos;m going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it -- education in world religions , on world religions , for all of our children in primary school , in high school , in public schools , in private schools and in home schooling .
is it totalitarian to require reading , writing and arithmetic ?
the only cost in most flocks is a loss of free mating .
and i think some people may have misunderstood .
suddenly , we humans , a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature , have grown in population , technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .
in other words , we have these hijackers -- you &apos;ve seen this slide before , from four years ago -- a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior on behalf of a cause other than one &apos;s own genetic fitness .
it &apos;s to bring purpose to the lives of millions , and he has succeeded .
just enough repetition .
yes , there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong .
now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical .
you &apos;ve got a reasonable objection to it ?
philosopher dan dennett calls for religion -- all religion -- to be taught in schools , so we can understand its nature as a natural phenomenon . then he takes on the purpose-driven life , disputing its claim that , to be moral , one must deny evolution .
that &apos;s the way we talk , right guys ?
and now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed .
have a foreground , a background , all in beautiful proportion .
it &apos;s a fantastic antidote to schizophonia ; to make music and sound in a group of people , whichever style you enjoy particularly .
so i went to vermont to not back to school camp , where there &apos;s unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out and willing to try anything .
this is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest .
anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive , and you can use those together .
and you can literally draw joysticks and just find pacman on your computer and then just hook it up .
i love when people put humans on the diagram .
jay silver : hack a banana , make a keyboard !
and yet black holes may be heard even if they &apos;re not seen , and that &apos;s because they bang on space-time like a drum .
he did not believe they existed in nature .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn &apos;t , anymore than light can escape .
but i &apos;d like to play for you the sound that we predict .
now that &apos;s our prediction for what we &apos;ll see .
so imagine you &apos;re inside the big bang .
will it happen again ?
and so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs , we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities , but rather extremely dynamic .
this is mr. lopez , who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months , and he &apos;s providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene , more calm , less apt to violence .
but ironically , this situation has empowered all of us , because we are considered , as artists , central to the cultural , political , social discourse in iran .
and yet , i had an unusual position toward this .
these are some of the shots actually from my film .
i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice , and their voice is giving me my voice .
that bigness should be centered on oneself , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wield , not in terms of any status that you can command in the society , but it should be centered on oneself .
and that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people , you do something that makes a difference in somebody &apos;s life -- even words , even time .
there &apos;s no choice in this : that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you , cannot be minus you .
to discover compassion , you need to be compassionate .
do it .
and as soon as i put those first youtube videos up , something interesting happened -- actually a bunch of interesting things happened .
this clearly was helping people .
you &apos;ve given the lectures , so now what we do ... &quot; -- and this could happen in every classroom in america tomorrow -- &quot; ... what i do is i assign the lectures for homework , and what used to be homework , i now have the students doing in the classroom . &quot;
and then you go build on that in the next concept .
it &apos;s like one plus one is equal to two .
or even better , &quot; let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their peer . &quot;
and it makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from were really just due to a coincidence of time .
i &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a rockstar team doing the software .
we made some of those for students so they could see their data , but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves .
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
i see cats and dogs walking towards me .
she was a bright old lady , perfectly sane . she had no medical problems .
his grandfather had these hallucinations .
this repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
kermit the frog means nothing to me . &quot;
and the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations , full of feeling , full of familiarity , located in space and time , coherent , dramatic .
and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells , which can be very , very specific .
so this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice , for patients , for doctors , for the public .
os : thank you . thank you .
and you &apos;ll note there &apos;s no light coming from them right now , either because they &apos;re dead -- or because i need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like .
i just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing .
so it can actually hold itself in very strong currents , as you see here .
we &apos;re talking to something .
it &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
but through science , we do have a fairly good idea of what &apos;s going on down at the molecular scale .
i was very much inspired by this image many years ago , and i wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world .
this is work from a number of years ago , but what i &apos;ll show you next is updated science , it &apos;s updated technology .
now we &apos;re going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes and look at its structure and describe it .
and you &apos;ll see , there &apos;s this one little last bit that &apos;s still remaining red .
there is going to be no turning back .
during 41 years of teaching biology at harvard , i watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non-required courses in science because they were afraid of failure .
in selecting a subject in which to conduct original research , or to develop world-class expertise , take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited .
scientists , pure mathematicians among them , follow one or the other of two pathways : first through early discoveries , a problem is identified and a solution is sought .
and the central , but not all-important , role of competition and survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room .
now , commerce is ancient . markets are as old as the crossroads .
and although they were screened and didn &apos;t know about the game and had never played the game before , proposers seemed to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50 / 50 .
commerce is ancient . markets are very old . capitalism is fairly recent ; socialism emerged as a reaction to that .
is an apollo project of cooperation possible ?
this wonderful one which i don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
all right , guys , are you there ?
all right , and now there &apos;s one last ted talk that microsoft has given in the past several years .
but instead , people go down , and after they recover , they go up again .
and people said yes , and they built with these legos .
and if they said yes , we gave them the one that they built and we broke .
what happened in the sisyphic condition ?
but the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation .
and this is basically the result we had before .
but when i finish it , i seem to like those ikea pieces of furniture more than i like other ones .
and these were all novices , and they built something that was really quite ugly -- nothing like a frog or a crane .
when you looked at the hard instructions , the effect was larger .
he gave an example of a pin factory .
well to explain that , i &apos;ve got a short video clip to explain the khmer rouge regime during 1975 and 1979 .
and in fact they were forced to work the fields .
and freedom from persecution from the khmer rouge .
one day a man told me , &quot; my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . &quot;
&quot; because you have felt me , i can feel myself again . &quot;
so , from 2008 up until today , a substantial change and step forward has been taking place .
and also -- i think -- without psycho-social therapy , and without considering this in all humanitarian projects , we cannot build-up civil societies .
let &apos;s have our cars go at 60 miles per hour .
let &apos;s add european countries in blue , and you can see there &apos;s quite a variety .
well , we can measure renewables in the same units and other forms of power production in the same units , and renewables is one of the leading ideas for how we could get off our 90 percent fossil fuel habit .
they all have a small power per unit area , and we have to live with that fact .
the energy consumption of this typical tank here is 80 kilowatt-hours per hundred person kilometers .
and people talk a lot about smart meters , but you can do it yourself .
since i was a boy , in my early childhood , i always wanted to be a musician , and , thank god , i made it .
music is life .
the child becomes a role model for both his parents , and this is very important for a poor child .
we are going live now to caracas .
we call these behavioral markers .
if they have a family member who is a key part of their care network , we fly and study them as well .
so , one of the reasons it &apos;s so challenging to prepare for this y2k problem is , i want to argue , we have what i would call mainframe poisoning .
we &apos;re not thinking about how do we shift from the mainframe to the home .
mimi broke her pelvis , lay all night , all morning , finally somebody came in and found her , sent her to the hospital .
these are two different subjects in our study .
so , you know , that &apos;s my last message to you .
people normally write that down , by the way .
you can email the cybercriminals and they &apos;ll tell you how to set up your illegal hacking server .
now if i place the mouse cursor over it , this is what we call a command prompt , and using this we can navigate around the computer .
what &apos;s really insulting about this is not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data , but when the scan finishes , they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses , you have to register the product .
one of these was more stereotypical for me .
so i ran a little scan .
next time you install something , look at the settings and ask yourself , &quot; is this information that i want to share ?
i wanted to be a paleontologist , a dinosaur paleontologist , and i wanted to have a pet dinosaur .
but it is that social thing that i guess attracted michael crichton .
they found these red circular-looking objects , and they looked , for all the world , like red blood cells .
but mary went further .
birds are living dinosaurs .
we started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a maltese .
we can save that one .
so that &apos;s the other gene we &apos;re looking for .
this was great . my pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork . i sold that pork to my school friends &apos; parents , and i made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance .
and that &apos;s what i came up with .
where does it end up ? we &apos;re used to seeing the stuff on our plates , but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between ?
it &apos;s called sheep &apos;s organs .
it &apos;s unscientific . it &apos;s unnecessary .
oh , man . um , yes .
that , of course , is the slavic swamp mermaid .
left to the thymiamata .
so , i look to you , fellow member of the earth community .
there are no jovians .
i suggest the house .
now this is isaac from a vietnamese stamp .
rené descartes , of course . once again these grenada people , this is like way too sick for anybody &apos;s imagination .
and i wonder if the photographer said , &quot; okay , jude , could you touch your tooth ? that &apos;s good . &quot;
you can see , even if you don &apos;t go for the numbers , the beauty of the symmetry .
because this is the place if aliens land , i hope they come here .
multiply them together , 18.618 x 19.618 is 365.247 .
that attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days , and in fact , it wasn &apos;t just the people on the network , but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the internet itself .
imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
when you pump gas , you really don &apos;t think you &apos;re using the internet .
but people won &apos;t decide to do it until they recognize the need for it , and that &apos;s the problem that we have right now .
as a result , the americans take the threat very seriously .
in may 2007 , estonia was the victim of cyberattacks , that damaged its communication and banking systems .
more and more , nations are waging attacks with cyber weapons -- silent strikes on another country &apos;s computer systems that leave behind no trace . guy-philippe goldstein shows how cyberattacks can leap between the digital and physical worlds to prompt armed conflict -- and how we might avert this global security hazard . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i saw forests and meadows .
so , what i &apos;d like to do now is try a little drawing .
try and inflate it .
or , sometimes i take them to places that people have never heard of because they &apos;re underwater .
and it ended up in the boise river and then on to the columbia river and then to the mouth of the columbia and to the pacific ocean and then on to this place called the great pacific garbage patch -- which is this giant pacific gyre in the north pacific , where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around -- and then back onto the lagoon .
meanwhile , ernest finds his fins on the internet .
and they turn up the lights .
my job description was deliciously vague : wilderness assessment and public relations .
the tahltan need your help . we need your help .
594 . let &apos;s give three of them a nice round of applause there .
529 .
audience : oh , 722 .
i can probably do it .
079044 .
fifth -- was that a wednesday ?
&apos;66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966 -- and what month ?
i know as a magician we &apos;re not supposed to reveal our secrets , but i &apos;m not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week , so -- i think we &apos;re ok .
there &apos;s definitely a method to my madness -- definitely , definitely . sorry .
it would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at lawrence berkeley labs .
no , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
and i &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but i don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because -- however , the &quot; d &quot; in ted of course stands for design .
we &apos;re studying physics , i &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; that &apos;s a good thing to do .
is true . is true . i teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
but meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
i &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; i got to clear out of here ! &quot;
so , at this time , i &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the hayes hall tower bells : &quot; all truth is one .
first up : crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in manhattan with partners mutopo and jovoto.com .
in the winning life edited scheme in a render here , we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space .
so , here we go : a flyby of play .
this is in nature : it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death .
we &apos;re going to look at body play , which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity .
if you want to belong , you need social play .
i think that -- that &apos;s a few years back -- i think that wave is past , and the play wave is cresting , because there is some good science .
and i think if you think about life without play -- no humor , no flirtation , no movies , no games , no fantasy and , and , and .
kevin carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances : alcoholic mother , absent father , inner-city philadelphia , black , had to take care of a younger brother .
so what will follow is a student-made film about just that .
and if you look at sleep and dreams biologically , animals sleep and dream , and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams .
so this dish in particular is basically champagne with seafood .
and basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this .
so here &apos;s the next challenge .
and when we take out the u.s. and look at the remaining 21 percent , we see a lot of iraq -- that &apos;s that big green thing there -- and little else .
alisa miller , head of public radio international , talks about why -- though we want to know more about the world than ever -- the us media is actually showing less . eye-opening stats and graphs .
and so , to give an example , this is a project from last year , which is called the interstitial fragment processor .
thanks . so . and this project here , i was working with the great abstract vocalist , jaap blonk .
and so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects .
in this case , the opto-isolator is blinking in response to one &apos;s own blinks .
hollywood does this all the time , of course .
it &apos;s actually a fairly common picture .
a group of hunters approach , their packs loaded with wild game .
but it can &apos;t be the fault of somebody like this .
ubald laughs at me when i show this photo because of course you can &apos;t see his face .
through generous support and partnership scientifically with google.org and the skoll foundation , we were able to start the global viral forecasting initiative and begin work in four different sites in africa and asia .
and that &apos;s kind of what &apos;s happened with twitter , time after time .
twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium : you send one message and it goes out to everybody , and you receive the messages you &apos;re interested in .
i &apos;ve learned to follow the hunch , but never assume where it will go .
i was also an early writer , and when i began to write , at about the age of seven , stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read , i wrote exactly the kinds of stories i was reading : all my characters were white and blue-eyed , they played in the snow , they ate apples , how lovely it was that the sun had come out .
and so we had , as was the norm , live-in domestic help , who would often come from nearby rural villages .
i must say that before i went to the u.s. i didn &apos;t consciously identify as african .
a few years ago , i visited mexico from the u.s .
i had read tyler and updike and steinbeck and gaitskill .
what if we had an african television network that broadcast diverse african stories all over the world ?
many stories matter .
we &apos;ve become addicted to their certainty , their assuredness , their definitiveness , and in the process , we have ceded our responsibility , substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom .
a common thinking error of radiologists , for example -- when they look at ct scans -- is that they &apos;re overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient &apos;s problem to be .
encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts , which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true .
my dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life , and i &apos;ve spent the last decade watching him disappear .
when you care for someone with dementia , and you get training , they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar , hands-on , open-ended .
even when it &apos;s so hard .
alright ? that &apos;s not something that we can finance or buy today .
it looks like a car wash . you come into your car wash .
in a sense what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve created a new consumable .
peres thought that was a great idea .
i know most people don &apos;t think of israel as a small island , but israel is an island -- it &apos;s a transportation island .
here is the problem : at 147 dollars a barrel , which we were in six months ago , the u.s. spent a ton of money to get oil .
we looked at an mit study : ten million electric cars on the global roads .
the business model in which the money that is actually coming in , to drive the car -- the minutes , the miles if you want , that you are all familiar with -- subsidize the price of the car , just like cellphones . you &apos;ll pay for the miles .
that &apos;s , in the additive , about 25 percent of our problem .
that splendid music , the coming-in music -- &quot; the elephant march &quot; from &quot; aida &quot; -- is the music i &apos;ve chosen for my funeral -- -- and you can see why . it &apos;s triumphal .
this book , &quot; finding darwin &apos;s god , &quot; by kenneth miller , is one of the most effective attacks on intelligent design that i know , and it &apos;s all the more effective because it &apos;s written by a devout christian .
but here , i only want to make the point that the elegance of darwinism is corrosive to religion precisely because it is so elegant , so parsimonious , so powerful , so economically powerful .
and the first paper is a standard scientific paper presenting evidence , &quot; iridium layer at the k-t boundary , potassium-argon dated crater in yucatan , indicate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
nevertheless , it &apos;s an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as mr. hitler or miss beelzebub .
in 1998 , larson and witham polled the cream of american scientists , those who &apos;d been honored by election to the national academy of sciences , and among this select group , belief in a personal god dropped to a shattering seven percent .
so , what other words might be used to smooth the path , oil the wheels , sugar the pill ? darwin himself preferred &quot; agnostic &quot; -- and not only out of loyalty to his friend huxley , who coined the term .
we , who are atheists , are also a-fairiests and a-teapotists .
many of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief that we should respect religion , but i also suspect that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as i do .
now , let me tell you a different story . around june 2002 , the world of supercomputers had a bombshell .
another portion is not only how content is produced , but how relevance is produced .
may i do this ? it &apos;s open for anyone to create and innovate and share , if they want to , by themselves or with others , because property is one mechanism of coordination .
that &apos;s what ibm does in software services , and they &apos;ve done reasonably well .
and i want to start by telling you a story about that change in africa .
in this country , if you receive stolen goods , are you not prosecuted ?
can you believe that prior to this reform -- which started at the end of 2003 , when i left washington to go and take up the post of finance minister -- we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history ?
and we could hardly even pay anything , any salaries , in the economy .
standard chartered has brought in 140 million .
if we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet , isn &apos;t that a wonderful opportunity ? isn &apos;t that the way to go ?
ngozi okonjo-iweala : want to help africa ? do business here
so , i &apos;m here to trumpet vaccines for you .
dendritic cells , or macrophages , capture the virus and display pieces of it .
it was easily transmitted , but , luckily , was pretty mild .
in addition , these researchers found a new site on hiv where the antibodies can grab onto , and what &apos;s so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates .
if you can cripple these with specific antibodies , you could cripple all versions of the flu .
what if that wild bird flies by again ?
will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
you also can use adjuvants , which are chemicals you mix .
they have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption .
it &apos;s taken out of africa .
i belong to an internet discussion forum , an african internet discussion forum , and i asked them , i said , &quot; since 1960 , we &apos;ve had exactly 204 african heads of state , since 1960 . &quot;
by raking it off the backs of their suffering people .
first one is the political system .
they own farms . they decide what to do , what to produce .
the men are going fishing in these small boats .
and zuckerberg said , &quot; a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in africa . &quot;
but a couple of weeks ago , i asked a bunch of friends to google &quot; egypt &quot; and to send me screen shots of what they got .
and they were looking at the netflix queues , and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed , which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses .
and so now , we &apos;re kind of back in 1915 on the web .
i know it sounds like a little thing to you , but -- -- i looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me .
three days later , i got a nice , long , handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague bill clinton saying , &quot; congratulations on the new restaurant , al ! &quot;
not quite there yet .
many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it .
we are one .
one of the things that really impresses me about the people in the gulf : they are really , really aquatic people .
if you go to the place where the oil has been a while , it &apos;s an even bigger mess .
but you can see it .
it &apos;s going to take longer for some things .
but they concentrate in the gulf and then fan out all across the arctic .
it &apos;s just ridiculous .
it would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making 30,000 holes in the sea floor of the gulf of mexico looking for oil , oil might start coming out of one of them .
the first offshore drills were called harpoons .
i started building this project when i was about 12 or 13 years old .
taylor wilson believes nuclear fusion is a solution to our future energy needs , and that kids can change the world . and he knows something about both of those : when he was 14 , he built a working fusion reactor in his parents &apos; garage . now 17 , he takes the stage at short notice to tell his story .
everybody : i am my connectome .
now you &apos;ve probably seen pictures of neurons before .
how can we find an entire connectome ?
because if you look at a brain with your naked eye , you don &apos;t really see how complex it is , but when you use a microscope , finally the hidden complexity is revealed .
well , it &apos;s true .
neural activity is its water , and the connectome is its bed .
and if you appreciate that number , you can easily see there is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain .
we have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies .
if you come to my apartment and see my closet , i &apos;m sure you &apos;d figure out why : it &apos;s a mess .
in addition , you can see from the diagram on the right , the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet .
i would make a spear that , when you went deep sea diving , you could catch the fish really fast , and then roll it back up , and you could swim easier ... yeah .
sj : excellent , thank you .
so with simple electronics , you can detect how much the page is being bent .
but more seriously , they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans , and say if it &apos;s safe for the firemen .
it was outlawed in chicago for a while .
what &apos;s natural about foie gras ?
now , look at the guy .
but he was still going like this .
the landscape is incredible .
well , because he doesn &apos;t force feed , because he doesn &apos;t gavage tons of corn , his livers were pretty grey .
and this squadron of geese come over .
think about that for a minute .
there &apos;s 100 percent star anise in there .
i really was moved .
the pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .
jonas salk has a great quote .
could we have fuel without fear ?
we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply .
the sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates , that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones .
in the five years ending with 2010 , walmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design .
and deutsche bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016 .
half of that runs pumps and fans .
in 2010 , renewables other than big hydro , particularly wind and solar cells , got 151 billion dollars of private investment , and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding 60 billion watts in that one year .
that is , they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly .
now our team at rmi helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives , with some more hatching .
and as i went village to village , i remember one day , when i was famished and exhausted , and i was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me .
recently , the world bank opened its vault of data for public use , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data .
but , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
now after carolyn , and all the other guys , i feel like shit .
me , i have strictly no power to change anything .
because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today .
if you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go , &quot; i see you , oh my god you are here , how are you , i can help you , i can design for you a new toothbrush , new toilet brush , &quot; something like that .
it &apos;s very , very , very important .
you must go back to politics , you must go back to radicalization , i &apos;m sorry if that &apos;s not very english .
the only rule is , we have not to have any idea about the next story .
and this young man , his name is -- his last name cruz -- he loved it . that &apos;s all over his facebook page and it &apos;s gone viral .
and the drill sergeant starts screaming at them , and telling them to do all kinds of awful things .
when does the learning process begin ? does it begin in first grade ?
it &apos;s predictable .
and they did , and it brought me up to 2.0 .
they never did anything .
i even did it when i was secretary of state .
management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff .
the ultimate empowerment of customers is to ask them not to buy .
or as the ballet dancer alonzo king said , &quot; what &apos;s interesting about you is you . &quot;
yet , nothing was happening .
it was an educational campaign .
it was an amazing story -- how everyone started feeling the ownership .
and when i saw the street on the 25th , i went back and said , &quot; egypt before the 25th is never going to be egypt after the 25th .
and that was a personal belief , regardless of what &apos;s going on , regardless of the details .
what we see here is a mother in india , and she &apos;s speaking koro , which is a newly discovered language .
so the question arises : when do those citizens of the world turn into the language-bound listeners that we are ?
and we tested this by exposing american babies who &apos;d never heard a second language to mandarin for the first time during the critical period .
thankfully , we have a new machine , magnetoencephalography , that allows us to do this .
at the same time , i probably owe you some explanation about the images that you just saw .
let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances .
so that was the second project .
so the images that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle , and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees .
i looked into her face .
and that woman did not have sentimental compassion .
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paralyzed by fear .
and that is the mental quality of equanimity .
i believe that women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men -- with their fathers , with their sons , with their brothers , with the plumbers , the road builders , the caregivers , the doctors , the lawyers , with our president , and with all beings .
suppose you like to square numbers , and frankly , who doesn &apos;t ?
why should the squares of one , one , two , three , five and eight add up to eight times 13 ?
i was one of the founding members of the axis of evil comedy tour .
and he started asking me questions .
that &apos;s what i try and show in my stand-up . there &apos;s good people everywhere .
and it &apos;s great , there &apos;s good people everywhere .
not in the middle east .
so the type of magic i like , and i &apos;m a magician , is a magic that uses technology to create illusions .
you were great .
the brain is very good at forgetting .
when i asked my friend why the red brigades want to talk to me , he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported my name .
because they had no idea .
and there are three main stages .
now , deregulation also brought back rogue economics .
what does it mean ? that means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have .
why did this happen ? this happened because the patriot act was a unilateral legislation .
now , some of you might be thinking , &quot; hold on a minute . she doesn &apos;t look very much like an ocean rower .
i made a few changes , let go of some loose trappings of my old life , and through a bit of a leap of logic , decided to row across the atlantic ocean .
i was euphoric .
and finally : am i crazy ?
awful , really awful .
fortunately , the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier .
and then that story changed .
i couldn &apos;t just wait passively for happiness to come and find me .
and you &apos;re on the inside , and it &apos;s everything you hoped it would be .
child-prodigy piano player , he started on the squeezebox , and moved to a little more serious issue , a bigger instrument , and now to an even larger instrument , upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic , as you see here .
everyone here must own one , or at least they craved one the moment they saw one .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s cheaper .
only one of whom had ever seen the plans before .
or his restaurant , pod , in philadelphia , pennsylvania .
this is about a place in london called kiteflyer &apos;s hill where i used to go and spend hours going &quot; when is he coming back ? when is he coming back ? &quot;
i wanted a registered retirement savings plan that would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet .
i was going to be a wrestler . i had it all figured out .
i thought they were both pork chops .
in grade five , they taped a sign to the front of her desk that read , &quot; beware of dog . &quot;
you have to believe that they were wrong .
it &apos;s a song about people and sasquatches -- -- and other french science stuff .
it goes like this .
well , the wintering ground is also critical and it also is not protected , and is potentially , could be potentially , exploited for gas and mineral rights .
and this is just one of a number of mines , 10 mines so far right now .
and you can see in the context , it &apos;s just a relatively small section of one of 10 mining complexes and another 40 to 50 on stream to be approved soon .
just 70 miles downstream is the world &apos;s largest freshwater delta , the peace-athabasca delta , the only one at the juncture of all four migratory flyways .
what we need , is we all need to act to ensure that canada respects the massive amounts of freshwater that we hold in this country .
she also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures , often of animals , which she then completely covers in bindis , often with potent symbolism .
he creates these opulent tableaus inspired by hieronymus bosch , but also by the kashmiri textiles of his youth .
so for me , a well-crafted baguette , fresh out of the oven , is complex , but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated .
so let &apos;s do it . so here we go for the first time ever , a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network .
and i think you should do something unusual with them , because these are bonus minutes . you weren &apos;t going to have them anyway .
a recent study from brigham young university school of family life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real-life relationships with them .
so i had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms .
that lasted for more than a year , and it was the hardest year of my life by far .
i feel closer to my friends and family .
all right , i like the people doing both . you are overachievers .
sloth , giraffe , elephant , snake . okay , let &apos;s see what we got .
if you are regularly achieving the three-to-one positive emotion ratio , if you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time , if you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day , if you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower , you will live 10 years longer than everyone else , and here &apos;s where that math i showed you earlier comes in .
it &apos;s a project that now reaches across three continents , and its roots go into the fields of mathematics , marine biology , feminine handicraft and environmental activism .
i laughed and said , &quot; well we &apos;ve only just started it , you can have a little bit of it . &quot;
now some of you are sitting here thinking , &quot; what planet are these people on ?
you all have a sense of what a flat space is , euclidean space is .
it &apos;s a bit suspicious isn &apos;t it ? there is two answers to the question so far , zero and one .
here is this diagram in crochetness .
we started out , chrissy and i and our contributors , doing the simple mathematically perfect models .
they write these great symbolic treatises called books , and papers , and op-ed articles .
the first example is an extraordinary syndrome called capgras syndrome .
it &apos;s the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
and i &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , &quot; who are you ?
the phantom limb -- they &apos;ll say , &quot; but doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed .
well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obeying his command , right ?
he said , &quot; oh , i can &apos;t move my phantom . you know that . it &apos;s painful . &quot;
i thought maybe the mirror box was gone .
this was discovered by francis galton in the nineteenth century .
now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the bay area than in san diego .
and , hence , the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets , artists and novelists .
and i think it &apos;s a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
maybe it &apos;s something special in his brain that allows him to have language .
so the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier .
that &apos;s a wasps &apos; nest .
she switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel , rather than turns it .
panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods .
the next symbol panbanisha writes represents &quot; collar . &quot;
kanzi plays the xylophone ; using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies dr. sue &apos;s singing .
if you take 10,000 people at random , 9,999 have something in common : their interests in business lie on or near the earth &apos;s surface .
this picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about 100 patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky .
and so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small , which we don &apos;t yet have .
and i now move on to the second part of my talk , and the book &quot; our final century &quot; was mentioned .
and they were inspired not by the young einstein , who did the great work in relativity , but by the old einstein , the icon of poster and t-shirt , who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws .
the plaque reads , &quot; albert einstein lived here . &quot;
or will the biosphere stabilize ?
and instead of talking about how it had made them realize that money doesn &apos;t lead to happiness , everyone instantly started saying , &quot; you know what i would do if i won the lottery ... ? &quot;
so some people got this slip of paper and five dollars .
of course , these are undergraduates in canada -- not the world &apos;s most representative population .
she says , &quot; i bought a present for my mom .
and you can see , the world is crazily green .
you actually lose money because it doesn &apos;t motivate them to perform any better .
it &apos;s an extraordinary thing .
rabin &apos;s statement was a reflection of decades of security and intelligence collaboration between the two , which in turn was born out of perception of common threats .
the more iran got isolated , the more peace there would be .
iran and israel &apos;s conflict is a new phenomenon , only a few decades old in a history of 2,500 years , and precisely because its roots are geopolitical , it means that solutions can be found , compromises can be struck , however difficult it yet may be .
this is u.k. government data , a completely independent site , where does my money go .
every flash is an edit . somebody somewhere looking at the open street map , and realizing it could be better .
so 144,000 are called lester , which means about .05 percent is named lester .
well , here are the numbers from 2010 : .26 percent of america gave 200 dollars or more to any federal candidate , .05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate , .01 percent -- the one percent of the one percent -- gave 10,000 dollars or more to federal candidates , and in this election cycle , my favorite statistic is .000042 percent — for those of you doing the numbers , you know that &apos;s 132 americans — gave 60 percent of the super pac money spent in the cycle we have just seen ending .
it &apos;s a corruption relative to the framers &apos; baseline for this republic .
this is the root .
the analytics are easy here .
and what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son .
fifty years ago in the old soviet union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
but sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
now when i got out , i was diagnosed and i was given medications by a psychiatrist .
your call . your call .
is that what enabled you to synchronize ?
there are just three simple rules .
information can be sent over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism .
the combined light from these beetles -- these are actually tiny beetles -- is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers . it &apos;s stunning .
now comes the very risky part of my talk , which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize .
my wife pointed out to me that it will work better if i put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over .
interviewer : just sideways . about how much was it moving , do you think ?
but also , after you see the bridge on opening day , you &apos;ll see an interesting clip of work done by a bridge engineer at cambridge named allan mcrobie , who figured out what happened on the bridge , and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was .
am : it doesn &apos;t have to be a real dangle . just walk . it starts to go .
what he understood was that biological diversity -- crop diversity -- is the biological foundation of agriculture .
i wouldn &apos;t tell them what it was , but it was in alphabetical order , and i would tell them to look for their names , their family names , their mother &apos;s maiden name .
today &apos;s best variety is tomorrow &apos;s lunch for insects or pests or disease .
here &apos;s south africa . the same story .
this is above mainland norway . you can see greenland there .
there &apos;s 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now .
so , in a very real sense , i believe that we , as an international community , should get organized to complete the task .
this is male blogging posture sitting , and the result is , &quot; for greater comfort , men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women , when working on laptop .
and this research is being precipitated by the u.s. government , so you can see that your tax man is working for good causes .
i &apos;m particularly troubled that what nasa &apos;s doing right now with this new bush doctrine to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot , i screwed up .
the jet age started : the missile age started . von braun was on there showing how to go to mars -- and this was before sputnik .
here &apos;s the biggie , and that is , you don &apos;t have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it .
but i think once it does , we will find solutions , and very quickly , you &apos;ll see those resort hotels in orbit .
the military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the sr71 . it went a whole life cycle , got too rusty to fly , and was taken out of service . the concorde doubled the speed for airline travel .
and would you have thought , would the russians have thought , that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware , the guys inside won &apos;t be russians ? maybe it &apos;ll probably be a japanese or an american billionaire ? well , that &apos;s weird : you know , it really is .
yesterday &apos;s internet was a platform for the presentation of content .
now , what is openness ?
your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night .
sunlight is the best disinfectant .
the debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled .
the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom .
you know , bees come in swarms and fish come in schools .
let &apos;s do this . thank you .
and in these situations , angiogenesis is out of balance .
and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly .
so we created an antiangiogenic paste .
so to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer , i went back to look at cancer &apos;s causes .
here &apos;s some more data from our testing .
now , finally , i &apos;ve talked to you about food , and i &apos;ve talked to you about cancer , so there &apos;s just one more disease that i have to tell you about and that &apos;s obesity .
and there are many clinical trials .
so , very first puzzle , sixth grade , my teacher said , &quot; oh , let &apos;s see , that guy , he likes to make stuff .
and &quot; right answer , &quot; of course there might be more than one right answer ; many puzzles have more than one .
a few other things . here is my name .
and this follows the rules i just said : any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up .
i came up with this . this is railroad rush hour .
one of these weighs 50 pounds , 30 pounds and 10 pounds .
so , we got games like &quot; brain age &quot; coming out for the nintendo ds , huge hit .
okay , so that &apos;s the lens .
how do we bring up boys ? what does it mean to be a boy ?
their stories were so horrific , and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , i was shattered .
and they were all alone , and i thought , &quot; this is the secret life of men . &quot;
if we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them .
agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl , she was female genitally mutilated .
she knew she would have to marry that old man , and she was 14 .
and i want to do it for the girls that sunitha talked about yesterday , the girls who survive , the girls who can become somebody else .
don &apos;t you say all negative that it &apos;s only only a teenage thing , or it &apos;s only because i &apos;m a girl .
nothing &apos;s been diluted .
so at the actual trial , all six of the teenagers testified , and indicated the identifications they had made in the photo array .
well , what &apos;s that got to do with this ?
so in fact , we found the same identical conditions , we reconstructed the entire thing again , he came out with an entire brigade of sheriff &apos;s officers to protect him in this community , all right ?
three to four feet , it might as well have been a football field away .
they &apos;re dynamic .
so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books .
the ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter .
and when she dies , they have a ceremony where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity .
so some of these things , i &apos;d wander around the streets of dakar asking people , &quot; what &apos;s the algorithm ? what &apos;s the rule for making this ? &quot;
he said , &quot; but wind and dust goes through pretty easily .
so even plus odd gives you odd .
so it &apos;s really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that &apos;s about mathematics , that it &apos;s not just about singing and dancing .
we have blended families , adopted families , we have nuclear families living in separate houses and divorced families living in the same house .
one has lacrosse on the near side of town .
as sutherland told me , we got to that article , and said , &quot; that &apos;s it . &quot;
with kids , it &apos;s heaven . &quot;
my wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom .
we &apos;ll make sunday meals more important . &quot;
so we said , &quot; okay , give us a reward and give us a punishment . okay ? &quot;
adaptability is fine , but we also need bedrock .
suddenly we had a way into the conversation .
tolstoy became consumed with that stick , but he never found it .
so what &apos;s superhydrophobic ?
we &apos;ve certainly seen that today .
lewis carroll i &apos;m sure did alice . sweeney : what ? !
on a dark and stormy night -- really ! -- it was the 10th of july , 1856 .
i have been able , through careful invention , to transmit , with the mere flick of a switch , electricity across the ether .
nt : tell me , what will man do when the forests disappear , and the coal deposits are exhausted ?
but once in a while , things don &apos;t go so well , and there &apos;s trouble in these circuits , and there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring and causing trouble , or sometimes they &apos;re underactive and they &apos;re not quite working as they should .
and the difference between shaking in this way and not -- the difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior of 25,000 neurons in her subthalamic nucleus .
we realized that perhaps we could use this technology not only in circuits that control your movement but also circuits that control other things , and the next thing that we took on was circuits that control your mood .
so what we &apos;ve decided to do is we &apos;re going to try to turbocharge we &apos;re going to place electrodes within the circuits that regulate your memory and cognitive function to see if we can turn up their activity .
we are now learning to understand what are the circuits , what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for the clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases .
and the constraints in building any organism , when you look at it , are really severe . natural technologies have incredible constraints .
we took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well . we took their three legs , we collapsed them down as one .
so , you can put those properties in . it inspired them to show off this design by producing a little robot they named sprawl .
this is a graduate student . this is what he &apos;s doing to his thesis project -- very robust , if a graduate student does that to his thesis project .
here &apos;s the gecko running up a vertical surface . there it goes , in real time . there it goes again . obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit .
and if you zoom in 270 times , you &apos;ll see it looks like a rug .
we &apos;ll see where this goes . we were so excited about this that we realized that that small-size scale -- and where everything gets sticky , and gravity doesn &apos;t matter anymore -- we needed to look at ants and their feet , because one of my other colleagues at berkeley has built a six-millimeter silicone robot with legs . but it gets stuck . it doesn &apos;t move very well .
a recent study in the u.s .
i don &apos;t have the right answer .
my brother is kind of busy .
own your own success . &quot;
and i &apos;m about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me , but i think important .
when i go to the mommy-and-me stuff and i see the father there , i notice that the other mommies don &apos;t play with him .
don &apos;t leave before you leave .
those are all behaviors where people know what they &apos;re supposed to do .
they had a low-fear population , where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation , all based in science , but told them that , if you didn &apos;t brush and floss your teeth , you could get gum disease . if you get gum disease , you will lose your teeth , but you &apos;ll get dentures , and it won &apos;t be that bad .
the notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior .
we need to connect the information always with the action , and then that action feeds back into different information , and it creates , of course , a feedback loop .
actually , it &apos;s a spoof . it &apos;s not a real pharmaceutical ad .
so it spells those out in very clean terms , and that works .
all those other values , all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing , we summarize .
and so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that .
how do i integrate this information into the longer course of my life ?
i was here , planting my chunks , cutting up potatoes and planting it , and the bees were working on this tree ; bumblebees , just making this thing vibrate .
i had thought always -- and in fact , had written this in my first book ; this was a book about gardening -- that lawns were nature under culture &apos;s boot , that they were totalitarian landscapes , and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex .
you suddenly realize that consciousness -- which we value and we consider the crowning achievement of nature , human consciousness -- is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world .
so it helped me understand industrial agriculture , which of course is a cartesian system .
and the reason he &apos;s waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day , those larvae will hatch and he &apos;ll have a huge fly problem .
this is how the prairies were built , the relationship between bison and grasses .
it looks like the web did back in 1997 , right ?
if you &apos;re not , too bad . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
so i just recently dropped out of princeton and actually ended up for the first time in a bar , and i saw these happy hour things all over the place , right .
you should get points for doing this on time .
but let &apos;s use it consciously . like why have games that you can lose ?
and here we have a game that people play .
and in 12 hours , they were able to find all these balloons , all across the country , right .
here it &apos;s slightly logged .
you can see that there &apos;s a lot of data running around .
and what that means is we want to have more people who are healthy and educated .
we just released it in a test phase last month , and it &apos;s been taking off .
and he said , &quot; why don &apos;t i look at the news better ? &quot;
raise your hands .
but anyway , every year we &apos;ve taken the whole company on a ski trip .
and the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search , you really have to be smart .
and so basically , he thought he was dealing with something smart , and of course , you know , we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out , and it didn &apos;t quite work , and we don &apos;t have this feature anymore .
but i think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomenon , and in fact really emerged in the latter half of the 20th century as design became a tool of consumerism .
with innovations like the great western , we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit .
instead of starting with technology , the team started with people and culture .
hilary cottam , charlie leadbeater , and hugo manassei of participle have taken this idea of participation , and in their manifesto entitled beveridge 4.0 , they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state .
instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach where we make the best choice out of available alternatives , it encourages us to take a divergent approach , to explore new alternatives , new solutions , new ideas that have not existed before .
what kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle ?
pretty soon , a lengthy discussion ensued , and finally the manager came over to me and said , &quot; i am very sorry . we do not have sugar . &quot;
mark lepper and i did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question .
to insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships .
for modern americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world , choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is .
it &apos;s not a marker of liberation , but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae .
but there was a big difference .
but when you take a close look , you start to see the holes , and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways .
and as you just mentioned , there &apos;s lots of choices out there that are very visual these days .
now , of the women that could tell them apart , when the labels were off , they picked &quot; adorable , &quot; and when the labels were on , they picked &quot; ballet slippers . &quot;
so the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique of sailing and tacking of the wind to capture or intercept the oil that is drifting down the wind .
our small prototype has given us good insight that it &apos;s working very well , but we still need to work a lot more on this .
it &apos;s just an intellectual property setup .
then what we want to do is create six-meter versions so we can test the maximum performance of these machines , so we can go at very , very high speed .
ph : would you like to be the president of a tv network ?
by the year 2000 , the process was perfected . they merged with aol , and in just four years , managed to shed about 200 billion dollars of market capitalization , showing that they &apos;d actually mastered the art of applying moore &apos;s law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet .
and on the right-hand side , there &apos;s a scale that shows the rocket &apos;s velocity .
ph : you know , that one computer was huge .
it shipped every one of its computers with that game .
it led to lawsuits -- -- federal investigations , and lots of repercussions , and that &apos;s a scandal we won &apos;t discuss today .
but all that was about to change .
feed your head , feed your head , feed your head . &quot;
it became a killer app of links , and today , of course , we call that the world wide web .
the world and all its culture reduced to bits , the lingua franca of all media .
and it &apos;s no wonder that as we head into the writers &apos; strike , odd things happen .
what the entertainment business is struggling with , the world of brands is figuring out .
and whereas television may have gotten beat up , what &apos;s getting built is a really exciting new form of communication , and we kind of have the merger of the two industries and a new way of thinking to look at it .
you wouldn &apos;t look at this and call this a designer bike : a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum .
construction site in new york : red having this kind of emotional power that &apos;s almost an equivalent with the way in which -- cuteness of puppies and such .
and i came across this little street in venice , where the communist headquarters were sharing a wall with this catholic shrine .
and i do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society , such as bad form in restaurants , but quite seriously , it was a statement to me that one thing that you do , sort of , see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of , large masses of things , and when you -- in monoculture , and i think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that &apos;s important to us .
rob forbes : ways of seeing
and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes .
studied painting ; didn &apos;t do very well at that .
i conceived the kind of airplane .
he said she had one of the new , better chairs .
no arms at all .
now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it &apos;ll fit , you know , a tall guy and a short girl .
and that &apos;s not really the case .
and the answer is this thing .
this is a picture of fogging .
you just want to get this one .
and then we &apos;ve gone out into the big outdoors , always with local community consent , always with the necessary permits .
so that &apos;s where we stand at the moment , and i &apos;ve just got a few final thoughts , which is that this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area , and these biological approaches are coming in in very different forms , and when you think about genetic engineering , we &apos;ve now got enzymes for industrial processing , enzymes , genetically engineered enzymes in food .
and you know why i understand that ?
and if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , smoldering coal waste look like .
so , how many people are in the white ?
this could be my little assessment .
where you live : it impacts your health as much as diet and genes do , but it &apos;s not part of your medical records . at tedmed , bill davenhall shows how overlooked government geo-data can mesh with mobile gps apps to keep doctors in the loop . call it &quot; geo-medicine . &quot;
that links with hotdiggitydog.com .
right ?
and more importantly still , phosphorus is a key component of dna , something everyone is familiar with , and which is shown in this image .
yes , it is . what is worse is that it is very expensive .
what are we to do ? we are faced with a paradox .
i haven &apos;t invented anything at all ; it &apos;s a biotechnology that has existed for 450 million years .
and in some cases , in cuba , mexico and india , the dose can be reduced to 25 percent , and in several other cases , there &apos;s no need to add any phosphorus at all , because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil .
so , what &apos;s going on today which is calculus-based and which is using digital tools , and that has a lot of implications to the way we think about beauty and form , and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature .
so , this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and generic form .
i think that &apos;s one of the main changes , also , in architecture : that we &apos;re starting to look now not for some ideal form , like a latin cross for a church , but actually all the traits of a church : so , light that comes from behind from an invisible source , directionality that focuses you towards an altar .
so , the first kind of test product we did was with alessi , which was for a coffee and tea set .
and i think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large-scale construction .
but let &apos;s go back and drop it a little deeper and look during the daytime .
that area &apos;s about 30 million square kilometers , or about an africa &apos;s worth of land , a huge amount of land , and it &apos;s the best land , of course , is what you see . and what &apos;s left is , like , the middle of the sahara desert , or siberia , or the middle of a rain forest .
they really needed the money .
i don &apos;t know about you , but i &apos;m terrified that future archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about our time in history , and wonder , &quot; what were you thinking ? &quot;
more importantly , changing diets .
and i love silver buckshot . you put it together and you &apos;ve got something really powerful , but we need to put them together .
we use 2,800 cubic kilometers of water on crops every year .
must work together .
this is oshodi market in lagos .
big businesses have recognized this , and what &apos;s fascinating about this slide , it &apos;s not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads and run around without dropping them off .
versace without the vowels .
robert neuwirth : the power of the informal economy
here you see a patent for an arm in 1912 .
if they did , how would we tell them what to do ?
now you think , &quot; close hand , &quot; and a little section of your chest contracts .
his brain is thinking about his arm .
you see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use , and on the right , it is two months .
i was able to use my elbow and my hand simultaneously .
but i can &apos;t put in an electrode and say , &quot; go there . &quot;
tk : so we &apos;re really excited , because now we &apos;re getting to a clinically practical device .
so that &apos;s an exciting laboratory experiment on how to give back , potentially , some skin sensation .
and none of those problems could i have dealt with , but i have a really bright research team .
on the contrary , clinical trials are extremely useful tools , and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries .
is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed ?
thank you .
i mean , they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it .
and this is true of most of our living systems .
some years , the cold water goes all the way up to brazil , and other years , in these la nina years , it doesn &apos;t .
we usually don &apos;t , and we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost .
here , you can see in 2006 , they raised almost three quarters of a chick per nest , and you can see that they &apos;re closer to punta tombo ; they &apos;re not going as far away .
this is really pretty weird . &quot;
so , they really are pretty amazing creatures .
and we can try to anticipate those changes , and shape them in a more constructive direction .
stalin , khrushchev and other soviet leaders forced russians out to the far east to be in gulags , labor camps , nuclear cities , whatever the case was .
but hold on . this map is 700 years old .
the asian free trade zone , almost free trade zone , that &apos;s emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the pacific .
let &apos;s start with iraq .
these two arrows are an arc , an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure that link the west bank and gaza .
here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades .
in 2004 , 15 new countries joined the e.u .
let &apos;s not neglect the insurgency just to the south , balochistan . two weeks ago , balochi rebels attacked a pakistani military garrison , and this was the flag that they raised over it .
thank you .
and now i want to show what they actually look like in this movie here .
but it &apos;s really more like this : let &apos;s say you &apos;re a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s -- and you &apos;re a bachelor and you &apos;re dating people .
so what kind of hormones are these ?
it damaged the gene .
and many of these different genes , we &apos;ve shown , actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant .
and they all come and they fortify the house .
now i don &apos;t want you all to go out taking rapamycin .
just move to one side for us , if you would .
mr : thank you very much indeed , cynthia kenyon .
the problem with this model is that there are some amazing messages that need to be said that aren &apos;t profitable to say .
a heroic effort is a collective effort , number one .
but that , as i said , we live in this environment where all these obstacles are being put in our way .
this view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders , like prozac , act by globally changing brain chemistry , as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup .
do these organisms even have emotion-like states , or are they just little digital robots ?
so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state .
now what &apos;s the causal relationship , if anything , between these phenotypes ?
knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood ? that &apos;s awful , right ?
they had a very strong preference for biting on the face .
and so we set up another crazy experiment , because we collected the smell of these larvae , put it on pieces of cloth , and then did something very remarkable .
don &apos;t worry , i do this all the time in the lab .
but not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate .
i was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos .
but in 2007 , two remarkable individuals , shinya yamanaka of japan and jamie thomson of the united states , made an astounding discovery .
what lies ahead ?
we are very happy to have the possibility to be with you in the other side of the world .
and some of them will even still be enjoying each others &apos; company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore .
for example , the happy wife .
they actually call it the oscar curse .
so i hope you &apos;ll use the information i &apos;ve given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors .
but think for a moment what that means .
now , i &apos;m by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is .
whenever a flash of light hits the receptor , the pore opens , an electrical current is switched on , and the neuron fires electrical impulses .
since we took these first steps , the field of optogenetics has exploded .
in other words , the fly should learn from mistakes that it thought it had made but , in reality , it had not made .
in this electronic toy circuit , the mushroom body neurons are symbolized by the vertical bank of blue leds in the center of the board .
i want to share some personal friends and stories with you that i &apos;ve actually never talked about in public before to help illustrate the idea and the need and the hope for us to reinvent our health care system around the world .
now , this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today , and you &apos;ll notice , on the edge of this image , there &apos;s some dark spots there , which was really concerning to me .
okay , that &apos;s good . how about up a little bit ?
now i personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age .
and this happens to millions of people every year .
it &apos;s like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live .
i hope you will go out and make personal health happen for yourselves and for everyone . thanks so much .
this the first time someone has actually climbed with it .
you see something on it . it &apos;s not just to look like a gecko .
and when i went back to research this , i realized that one of the great ted moments in the past , from nathan , we &apos;ve talked about an active tail .
what we discovered was the world &apos;s fastest air-righting response .
and it &apos;s better than that , it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air .
and the next video you see is the first time we &apos;ve showed this .
and then the last thing on the list there , ocean acidification -- if you were to ask me , you know , &quot; what do you worry about the most ?
you know , from an oceanic perspective , 450 is way too high .
i &apos;ll show you a few examples of this now .
this is the part of antarctica that we worry about .
this was completely unexpected .
and just so you know , 1982- &apos; 83 , that el nino killed 95 percent of all the corals here in galapagos .
now the reason we know it &apos;s 1584 is that these corals have growth bands .
some of them show greater variability .
so one of the things we &apos;re seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain their shells .
so , i &apos;d like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions .
that is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
now , but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded , two questions immediately arise from his observation .
so many people worked on it , but by the &apos; 40s , certainly by the &apos; 50s , this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away .
it &apos;s built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy , vibrating in different frequencies .
and the wonderful thing is , if those numbers had any other values than the known ones , the universe , as we know it , wouldn &apos;t exist .
now , the second issue that i want to finish up with is : how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly ?
i want to start with a game .
but first , we have to ask another question , which is , &quot; what is color for ? &quot;
completely different meanings , giving rise to the exact same retinal information .
so , if i could have the lights down up here .
and the same thing over on the right .
so here we have -- let &apos;s turn this around -- a diamond .
we pull them out , put them in the fridge , and they fall asleep .
well , one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world .
because what i &apos;ve been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty .
you could feel secure even if you &apos;re not .
they &apos;re just part of being alive ; we all do it .
one example would be , people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports kidnapping by relatives is much more common .
so one half , one quarter , one fifth -- we &apos;re good at that .
okay , so what makes people not notice ?
it &apos;s , of course , limited by science , by technology .
so models can change .
by autumn , people thought the doctors should have solved this already .
models are hard to dislodge .
we rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe .
and i want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this .
it &apos;s not just reality ; it &apos;s feeling and reality .
that child already , at four , understood the most important principle for success , which is the ability to delay gratification .
in other words , she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it , so she would get two .
and it was originally a freight line that ran down 10th ave .
and it turns out , we got those numbers wrong .
this is one of my favorite features , this flyover where you &apos;re eight feet off the surface of the high line , running through a canopy of trees .
let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today .
i happen to believe that libya was necessary and that military intervention in afghanistan was also necessary .
the international committee of the red cross , the icrc , is talking to everyone , and it is doing so because it is neutral .
right now , the discussion goes , &quot; should we talk to the muslim brotherhood ?
in his memoirs , &quot; long road to freedom , &quot; he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being , also being a human being .
this is perhaps a first element of a change .
jonas gahr støre : in defense of dialogue
some people think i am the nerd tony soprano , and in response , i have ordered a bulletproof pocket protector .
and she has studied the statues for 20-some years , and she has detailed records of every single statue .
now , this is the normal way it &apos;s done .
while i was at microsoft , i took a leave of absence and went to a chef school in france .
she is risking her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years -- may not ever .
so , you hike around and -- this is after you dig them up , they look like this .
this is one of my papers : &quot; a pygostyle from a non-avian theropod . &quot;
i just -- you know , because , yes , i &apos;ll focus passion on something , but then there will be something else , and then there &apos;s something else again .
it doesn &apos;t say how things are connected , what causes what and so on .
it &apos;s fundamental to darwin and mendel and so on .
and so the trick is -- unfortunately , we don &apos;t have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome .
so we started playing around with this .
we overlay them . this is actual data .
so how do we diagnose that conversation ?
david got me invited to give a talk at national cancer institute and anna barker was there .
danny hillis : understanding cancer through proteomics
february 4th , we posted it on our website . this was before super tuesday .
this is the kid who shot up virginia tech .
but here is the point . if you believe and you say to people in your tribe , in effect , &quot; my life sucks .
that is a meeting of a stage three tribe .
so when individuals come together and find something that unites them that &apos;s greater than their individual competence , then something very important happens .
well , in fact , there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings that come out of all this .
so the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society .
see , people who build world-changing tribes do that .
you &apos;re hearing one presentation after another , often representing a group of people , a tribe , about how they have changed the world .
or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment ?
the most perfect examples occupy corner lots .
the relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate .
but compassion , from my vantage point , has a problem .
now &quot; kindness &quot; might sound like a very mild word , and it &apos;s prone to its own abundant cliche .
and as a teacher of yoga , he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability , health , illness and aging .
and i &apos;ll never forget hearing that story from dr. rachel naomi remen , who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her , that in the beginning of the creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces .
i want to show you the rest of this photograph , because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word &quot; compassion &quot; in our culture -- we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life , which is messy .
but compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious .
and so i put my books away , back in their suitcase , and i put them under my bed , and there they stayed for the rest of the summer .
not all the time -- these things aren &apos;t absolute -- but a lot of the time .
and we all fall at different points , of course , along the introvert / extrovert spectrum .
even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you &apos;re attracted to , you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
so that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
and even away from the podium , when you called him to say hello , he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time .
we need to be teaching kids to work together , for sure , but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own .
and once i put that in context , i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about technology : why i believe technology is a tremendous enabler ; a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges .
when i was out with my friends drinking beer , i always was very aware of those words -- -- and very careful . one of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful , of course , but it can only be helpful too if it &apos;s accessible , and it can only be helpful if it &apos;s affordable .
and so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well , where are we related to our goal towards 2015 , the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces .
and frankly -- and i know that sometimes i offend some of my customers when i say this , but i truly mean it -- if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it , it would be very difficult to judge who made it , because they &apos;re all highly commoditized but they &apos;re all different .
we just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the west cape in south africa , in a school that &apos;s called nelson mandela school , and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers , it &apos;s just phenomenal .
and it &apos;s really important you understand that for civilization to make progress , each generation has to do better than the last one .
i really think that &apos;s there &apos;s this inner desire .
um .
and i began to think about what i call the &quot; stewardship of affluence &quot; and the &quot; stewardship of influence . &quot;
they never really codify it or qualify it or quantify it , and say , &quot; this is what i believe in .
and having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals , it makes a difference .
it comes from serving .
basically , he &apos;s talking about all the marginalized in society .
and god says , &quot; throw it down . &quot;
i am a shepherd . it &apos;s a symbol of his identity , his career , his job .
and that gives with you enormous influence .
some people have the misguided idea that god only gets excited when you &apos;re doing , quote , &quot; spiritual things , &quot; like going to church or helping the poor , or , you know , confessing or doing something like that .
in colombia , we have about 3,000 laptops .
they need to learn learning . and then , just think -- they can have , let &apos;s say , 100 books .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; you know , all the signs we keep seeing with the chinese character on them . &quot;
so let me ask you guys something -- or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : how does it feel -- emotionally -- how does it feel to be wrong ?
you &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
when the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
the miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
we hold another conference .
so where &apos;s the link between these two things ?
and as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are , we &apos;re going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies . we &apos;re going to start thinking about biology entering energy . it is very expensive to process this stuff , both in economic terms and in energy terms .
so vivian and i have been working together for 23 years .
but given my befuddled state of mind , i ended up in the self-help section very quickly .
what we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid .
for the next three dozen years as king , this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in bhutan -- including , just recently , taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed , no coup .
how many of us here , as tedsters in the audience , spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation , in the denominator ?
so how do we do that ?
maybe it &apos;s time we get a toolbox that doesn &apos;t just count what &apos;s easily counted , the tangible in life , but actually counts what we most value , the things that are intangible .
when the dotcom bubble burst , hotelier chip conley went in search of a business model based on happiness . in an old friendship with an employee and in the wisdom of a buddhist king , he learned that success comes from what you count .
but actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
that &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
they were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
this is a science paper . we &apos;re going to try to get it published .
what you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
so , amy ?
those of us who earn a certain income level , we have something called choice .
now you think to yourself -- because i know how you are -- you say , &quot; that sure is terrible for those poor people .
a clamshell &apos;s hard .
and so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement .
so for once , perhaps , the government is ahead of itself .
historically you see that we got around 200 years ago by canals , and as that system disappeared , were replaced by railroads .
and then through the various years we invented various vehicles .
we actually get 175 horsepower into one cubic foot .
twenty-three percent said , &quot; as soon as it &apos;s proven safe . &quot;
think about it . whether that &apos;s you in that picture or something under your desk .
what dr. soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology , which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room .
there are industrial applications .
and as i said , in sort of about 10 seconds we should start to see ...
so , you know they don &apos;t make it easy at apple to get inside their phones .
to me , this says three things .
it &apos;s a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife .
i wanted to cultivate this perspective just like the mushrooms , so i formed the decompiculture society , a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options , seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the infinity mushroom .
only jerk wasn &apos;t the word i used .
it makes him so sick , he has to quit it , yet still he lives on .
it was an exhilarating fight , and i &apos;d repeat the fight today without a moment &apos;s hesitation .
i believed i could keep him from dying , and i &apos;d be embarrassed to say that if i hadn &apos;t seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way .
it &apos;s a feature .
the people are leaving . they &apos;re playing instruments .
so the virtual earth initiative , and other types of these initiatives , are all about extending our current search metaphor .
so a little unknown secret is -- did you see the one with the guy , he &apos;s got the web cam ?
an ortho-view , a nadir-view . how do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model ?
but over the last 30 years , china undoubtedly has done much better than india .
and for the sake of brevity , i &apos;ll call one country country 1 and the other country country 2 .
in fact , if you look at the evidence worldwide , the evidence is more supportive of the view that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth .
the problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lotteries , &quot; have you won the lottery ? &quot;
i haven &apos;t told you about the definition of literacy .
financial times printed this picture of an indian textile factory with the title , &quot; india poised to overtake china in textile . &quot;
in fact , when india was growing at a hindu rate of growth -- about one percent , two percent a year -- that was when india was least democratic .
i don &apos;t know whether that &apos;s going to happen or not , but i &apos;m an optimist .
i &apos;ve been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses for the last five years , because i &apos;ve been kind of on this quest to investigate this question of where good ideas come from .
so what prestero and his team decided to do is to look around and see : what are the abundant resources in these developing world contexts ?
this is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together , where people were likely to have new , interesting , unpredictable collisions -- people from different backgrounds .
and all of a sudden , the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head and he says , &quot; ah , at last , i had a theory with which to work . &quot;
and two of them , two 20-something researchers at the apl are there at the cafeteria table having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues .
and eventually , they get permission -- this is all a little side project that hadn &apos;t been officially part of their job description .
that is how innovation happens .
so we &apos;re living in the age of the global plutocracy , but we &apos;ve been slow to notice it .
as a result , if you are very , very smart and very , very lucky , you can get very , very rich very , very quickly .
one of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy can become crony plutocracy .
and in contrast with the industrial revolution , the titans of our new economy aren &apos;t creating that many new jobs .
we need a new new deal .
he said , &quot; look , there &apos;s a guy down here .
and , if that wasn &apos;t bad enough , of course , all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you , in fact , about one in 10 of you at this point , will die in intensive care .
it &apos;s an amazing picture .
i think we have to get onto this .
peter saul : let &apos;s talk about dying
i was a passive observer of the medical world .
and it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell .
so , i looked further into it , found as many articles as i could , and it was amazing -- because it turned out that it was very rare .
without angiogenesis , the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it &apos;s not harmful .
it &apos;s not harmful ; it has just repaired the muscle .
every time any westerners came to the village , she hid the girl .
and remember this picture , because i &apos;m going to show you another picture later , but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother , although she looks so western .
and the translator said , &quot; the grandmother says that she thinks she &apos;s dying , and she wants to know if you would take hyun-sook to america with you . &quot;
did i know anything about this ?
and i had this whole mental picture of , sort of like cinderella .
who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this ? &apos; &quot; and i said , you know , &quot; look , &quot; i said , &quot; you &apos;re absolutely right .
he actually agreed to the adoption .
the uncle went back to his family , and natasha and tim and gene and i went out to dinner .
and now there &apos;s smoke and flames coming by our windows -- we &apos;re on the eleventh floor .
then he said , &quot; do you have gaffer &apos;s tape ? &quot;
like , what could you do for a year ?
pledge of allegiance for the first time .
and i always thought that was a very annie hall kind of outfit .
that match was unambiguous .
and as you see on this animation , what kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star .
the copernican dream was unfulfilled .
so , we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own milky way galaxy harbors .
and a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well .
and the more we learn , the more that was reinforced .
it is unimaginably small .
astronomer dimitar sasselov and his colleagues search for earth-like planets that may , someday , help us answer centuries-old questions about the origin and existence of biological life elsewhere . preliminary results show that they have found 706 &quot; candidates &quot; -- some of which further research may prove to be planets with earth-like geochemical characteristics .
see , uganda coming down , zimbabwe coming down , russia went to one percent .
i would say , hiv is very different in africa .
so , this is the difference within tanzania .
unaids have done good data available , finally , about the spread of hiv .
hans rosling : hiv -- new facts and stunning data visuals
when you get to the 1970s , which is where this chart ends , the average briton is more than 10 times richer than the average indian .
he said it was &quot; because they have laws and rules invented by reason . &quot;
that is so right and so cool .
the scientific revolution was different from the science that had been achieved in the oriental world in a number of crucial ways , the most important being that , through the experimental method , it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before .
even in places like senegal , beginning in the early 20th century , there were major breakthroughs in public health , and life expectancy began to rise .
you probably assume that because the iphone was designed in california but assembled in china that the west still leads in terms of technological innovation .
now this picture shows the demolition of the chinese artist ai weiwei &apos;s studio in shanghai earlier this year .
he was an expert in latin american history .
this red dot marks the great basin of north america , and i &apos;m involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators .
how does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk ?
nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family , so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family , so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk , and over the last 380 million years , that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged , specialized , over and over and over again , to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today .
in fact , this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length .
that &apos;s how scytodes forages .
and we &apos;ve had a classic answer for coordination costs , which is , if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people , you start an institution , right ? you raise some resources .
so , i was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged &quot; mermaid parade . &quot; there were 3,100 photos taken by 118 photographers , all aggregated and then put under this nice , neat name , shown in reverse chronological order .
when you build cooperation into the infrastructure , which is the flickr answer , you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals , rather than moving the individuals to the problem .
you can see here , over at the end , our most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos , and you can see there &apos;s a few people who have taken hundreds of photos .
and the 80 percent zone is a no-carrot and no-stick zone .
there &apos;s a wonderful , small example going on right now .
stay-at-home moms . right ?
and the answer to that question is , it doesn &apos;t matter , because that &apos;s not the right question .
it was produced by analyzing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools . and doubtless the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week .
it &apos;s mainly starch , and starch , when you break it down -- what is starch ? it &apos;s -- thank you -- sugar , yes .
and on day two , we put those two pieces together . that &apos;s the epoxy .
that &apos;s called &quot; rounding . &quot;
again , transformed in stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage 11 as bread .
now , at least with seeds we have the potential for future life .
by the way , what &apos;s the hebrew word for clay ? adam .
third transformation . first transformation , alive to dead .
so , if i , kind of , break this bread , maybe we can share this now a little bit here .
i mean , you — i &apos;m just like , a hush , huh -- it &apos;s like -- it &apos;s beethoven , how can you say that ?
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m past that . we &apos;re not going to go into that .
i made my own faces , and had a company fabricate them , and the players follow these scores .
so with all these theatric elements , this pushes me in another role , and that would be , possibly , the dramaturge .
let me give you just one example of this .
15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
well it turns out that the babies , the new caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
we don &apos;t have to do anything . all we have to do is learn .
all right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
when children do experiments we call it &quot; getting into everything &quot; or else &quot; playing . &quot;
oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
i think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
that technology is simulating humans .
if i push chris a bit , like this , for example , he &apos;ll react to it .
and you repeat that process over and over again , until you have something that walks -- in this case , in a straight line , like this .
now , this might look kind of trivial , but it &apos;s actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .
i &apos;ll show you this again .
and what they said was , the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen .
this is a slightly different angle , and again a slow motion version of this .
now , this could do with a bit more work . it &apos;s still very early stages , and we pretty much just did this for a laugh , just to see what we &apos;d get out of it .
we can only do several behaviors right now .
torsten reil : animate characters by evolving them
you know , i don &apos;t even believe in the concept of an ideal family .
it &apos;s a children &apos;s book about indian independence -- very patriotic .
it &apos;s not enough your software crashed my mac and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my roms ! now the mac makes the sounds of silence .
over the years it &apos;s gotten easier to use .
but why is the technical overload crisis , the complexity crisis , accelerating now ? in the hardware world , it &apos;s because we the consumers want everything to be smaller , smaller , smaller .
and we &apos;ve arrived at the age of interface matrices , where there are so many features and options , you have to do two dimensions , you know : a vertical and a horizontal . you guys all complained about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically .
if you are buying something on the web , you &apos;re supposed to put in your address and you &apos;re supposed to choose which country you &apos;re from , ok ?
that is a company not counting taps .
but there &apos;s also a new microsoft that &apos;s really doing good , simple interface designs .
the other products were backed by microsoft with an open standard , not apple &apos;s propriety standard .
but the point is : i can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word and having it write out a much longer thing . so if somebody sends me a fan letter , i &apos;ll say , &quot; thanks for that . &quot;
we started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century , and how they &apos;d been improved , and very simple things turned out .
so the solution has to be , as people like russell and einstein and others imagine in a conversation that existed in a much stronger form , i think , early in the 20th century , that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart .
so after giving up on the book -- and i had the great honor to be able to join kleiner perkins about a year ago , and to work through venture capital on the innovative side , and to try to find some innovations that could address what i saw as some of these big problems .
we have a challenge , because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time . people are moving to the cities .
and so we begin to see , and we &apos;ve seen business plans already , where the kind of things lisa randall &apos;s talking about are in there .
we need new anti-virals and cocktails . we need new kinds of vaccines .
so if you tie that -- you have to tie that back with the law .
and perhaps , someday , far beyond our solar system itself .
and all of this seems to me to be a salient point in history .
there &apos;s clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place – one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed , and there are these amazing structures called blueberries , which are these little , rocky concretions that we are busy making biologically in my lab right now .
so they are , intrinsically , a slower life-form .
and yet , everything in this cave has adapted to it .
so , lava-tube caves-- i &apos;ve just told you about organisms that live here on this planet .
and these little guys -- you could lose many of them .
take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal , okay ?
so , if this is true , what can we do ?
and archimedes codex c was just one of those seven .
and it was an expensive job , but actually it wouldn &apos;t be as much as you think because these people , they didn &apos;t come from money , they came from archimedes .
and we imaged the manuscript in 14 different wavebands of light .
so an x-ray comes in in the diagram on the left and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom .
and this didn &apos;t exist in codices a and b .
he lived for another 10 years , then the macedonian faction caught up with him .
now we at the walters art museum have followed this example , and we have put up all our manuscripts on the web for people to enjoy -- all the raw data , all the descriptions , all the metadata .
benjamin wallace : now , that &apos;s about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world .
and then i took a bite , and i wished that it was tinier , because kobe beef is so rich .
it has four balconies .
it was very green , it was very peppery .
it &apos;s fully automated -- you walk towards it , and the seat lifts .
most of the cars that i drive , if i get up to 80 they start to rattle .
i went .
but i think , above all , i &apos;m in awe at their power to motivate , to compel us , to transfix us , like really nothing else we &apos;ve ever invented has quite done before .
this is a bit like ambition and drive -- i &apos;m going to do that . i &apos;m going to work hard .
now you can think about this , if you like , as a problem about boxes .
we also say there &apos;s going to be loads of other items of varying qualities and levels of excitement .
so what does all this mean in practice ?
now this is the neurological goldmine , if you like , because a known reward excites people , but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward , the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty , that they didn &apos;t quite know whether they were going to get it or not .
what happened was , they paid each other a virtual currency they called &quot; dragon kill points . &quot;
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and the neurological lessons we can learn from watching people that are playing games .
so to address this problem , i put together a team of international researchers in switzerland , denmark and the u.k .
and i hope i have convinced you of the value of dental calculus .
so we said screw it , we &apos;ll just start our own company , which we did three years ago .
well , the foods that are produced are , more or less , corn , soy and wheat .
and in one generation , they &apos;re going from hunger , and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger , to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation .
we all tend to think that these systems are quite different , and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world , but if we take a 30-year view , there &apos;s more hope in collaborative ideas .
we can only blame ourselves . over the last 50 years the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious .
but it has to be done together .
and this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership .
now , superfly , the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower , and you smear them across flytower and auditorium .
these are the two large pivoting doors that allow people to move directly from the outside , in or from the inside , out , performers or audience alike .
and so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations at will .
now , if there is anyone here from american airlines , please consider doing your christmas party here .
and to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
have fun in whatever you do . &quot;
&quot; i feel good . &quot;
so , really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story .
they have colors . what do they look like ?
this is the food we ate .
and it leads to just a completely different value system .
she wanted to keep farming until she dies .
he travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work , and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at .
i asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there , you know .
so if any of you have any bhutan travel plans in the near future , you can go check these out . here are some images from that .
if you know anything about anatomy , that &apos;s not a good thing to get cut , and everything , of course , on the way up , and then — i still had my hands up — he pulled it out and went for my neck , and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck , and i got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out .
like , now you can do whatever you want , like , you gotta get on with that .
that &apos;s beautiful , but let &apos;s face it , nobody talks that way .
it &apos;s almost impossible to do that with your hand except in shorthand , and then communication is limited .
so julie says , &quot; i just sent you an email . &quot;
jake : &quot; haha . slash i &apos;m watching this video with suns players trying to shoot with one eye . &quot;
and so , there are always — — there are always people worrying about these things and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning .
chris has asked me to do a short performance , and so i &apos;m going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes -- to do that , and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form .
the last 20 years has been the age of intervention , and afghanistan is simply one act in a five-act tragedy .
if the al-qaeda base was to be established near ghazni , we would hit them very hard , and it would be very , very difficult for the taliban to protect them .
this man , for example , mullah mustafa , tried to shoot me .
or general david richards to come in 2006 and say he had the strategy and the resources to deliver the &quot; crunch year . &quot;
in the british embassy in afghanistan in 2008 , an embassy of 350 people , there were only three people who could speak dari , the main language of afghanistan , at a decent level .
and finally , we need to understand that in bosnia and kosovo , a lot of the secret of what we did , a lot of the secret of our success , was our humility -- was the tentative nature of our engagement .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
how do you do that ?
that &apos;s what a hydrophilic surface does .
and the answer is , of course , yes .
that takes about two seconds to make .
prick a finger , you get some blood , about 50 microliters .
and we &apos;ll start by posing a little problem .
and we thought for a while of how you might do this and the way , in fact , you do it is what &apos;s shown here .
so , i actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people .
so , when we think about parts of the country like arkansas , you know .
you kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said , &quot; yes , barack obama &apos;s race was a problem for me . &quot;
in 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes .
so if you want to address it , the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races .
nate silver has data that answers big questions about race in politics . for instance , in the 2008 presidential race , did obama &apos;s skin color actually keep him from getting votes in some parts of the country ? stats and myths collide in this fascinating talk that ends with a remarkable insight .
so picture bell sitting in the outpatient department , students all around him , patients signing up in the emergency room and being registered and being brought in .
but you might not realize that our ability to look into the body in this simple way , using our senses , is quite recent .
and tate asked fildes to paint a painting of social importance .
one had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer , had a small breast cancer detected -- had her lumpectomy in the town in which i lived .
there was just no way .
and they immediately said to me , &quot; well you are describing a classic ritual . &quot;
&quot; i recall one patient who was at that point no more than a skeleton encased in shrinking skin , unable to speak , his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications .
some people call us debunkers , which is kind of a negative term .
people remember the hits ; they forget the misses .
what &apos;s more likely -- that arnold had a little extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship ?
first of all , there was no theory of planetary rings .
faces of all kinds are easy to see .
here &apos;s the virgin mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
very -- one of the top popular singers in england today , katie melua .
with all the legitimate concerns about aids and avian flu -- and we &apos;ll hear about that from the brilliant dr. brilliant later today -- i want to talk about the other pandemic , which is cardiovascular disease , diabetes , hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle .
four million of these babies die annually .
it &apos;s a wax-like substance with a melting point of human body temperature , 37 degrees celsius .
shortly after that i got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals .
nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance .
you can make a lot of change . you can get roads built .
it &apos;s about leading and connecting people and ideas .
he did it by creating a movement .
when diane hatz worked on &quot; the meatrix , &quot; her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated , she didn &apos;t invent the idea of being a vegan .
michelle kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture .
you don &apos;t need permission from people to lead them .
seth godin : the tribes we lead
essentially first , the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers at high levels in the bloodstream in the earliest stages , but also only in cancer .
you &apos;re going to save us all ! &quot;
it &apos;s a neutral space , where what you look like , age or gender , it doesn &apos;t matter .
: video clips from across the globe .
it &apos;s now a theme park .
these are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love .
so if there is a verb , for me , that comes with love , it &apos;s &quot; to have . &quot;
because sometimes , as proust says , mystery is not about traveling to new places , but it &apos;s about looking with new eyes .
is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes ?
it won &apos;t make a dent . there is nobody at the reception desk .
it starts very young . it continues into our sex lives up to the end .
they know how to bring it back , and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it &apos;s just going to fall from heaven while you &apos;re folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship already has .
i &apos;ve played the disney hall here and carnegie hall and places like that .
he can , very innovatively , actually change keys without risking huge dissonances .
it &apos;s larger than some of the other symphony halls .
same thing goes true for -- that &apos;s the beginning of the century -- for the whole of 20th-century popular music , whether it &apos;s rock or latin music or whatever .
and another new form of music was born .
and does it happen anywhere else ?
we sing .
and finally , john belk said , &quot; do you know who &apos;s sitting here ? &quot;
now , instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones , israel now had iron plows , and sickles , and hoes and military weapons .
even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle .
that &apos;s the part of us that yearns for god , or something more than we find in technology .
yes , to be sure , science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering .
technology projects the myth of control over our mortality .
i talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor .
in one of his plays , alexander solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying , who says to those gathered around his bed , &quot; the moment when it &apos;s terrible to feel regret is when one is dying . &quot;
king david lived to be 70 , a long time in his era .
thank you for the privilege . it was great .
gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
everything is everything .
resolutions , smoke .
two months later , i go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief .
2010 : a young woman stands before president sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together , their father and mother died during the war .
we created a space called the young girls transformative project .
this is another african girl &apos;s wish .
as part of my work , i &apos;m doing these tours in different villages and towns -- 13 , 15 hours on dirt roads -- and there is no community that i &apos;ve gone into that i haven &apos;t seen intelligent girls .
and one of the guys who already had a seat was very -- because liberia has one of the strongest rape laws , and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric .
his vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate in making decisions , controlling complex situations without the inflexible dependence on predetermined programs .
instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem , design the solution around what the human will do as well .
as appealing as it might sound , you cannot algorithmically data mine your way to the answer .
these were networks of mercenaries , not ideologues , who were in the coordination business for profit .
and i decided that i would try and turn my life around .
on the one hand , putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened .
you can &apos;t do it all in one day .
my wife , who is somewhere in the audience today , called me up at the office and said , &quot; nigel , you need to pick our youngest son &quot; -- harry -- &quot; up from school . &quot;
the area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city .
these impacts are coming everyone &apos;s way .
many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding .
physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety , the placement of the waste and other facilities , which , if done properly , don &apos;t compromise a community &apos;s quality of life .
anyway , i know chris told us not to do pitches up here , but since i have all of your attention : we need investors . end of pitch .
now , we &apos;ll have even less than that stat i told you about earlier .
his administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time , and on a third-world budget at that .
i have come from so far to meet you like this .
she wrote back to me and she said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make mother &apos;s day cards for their mothers . &quot;
you look online , you &apos;ll see places like codecademy and events like coderdojo and sites like girls who code , or black girls code .
here &apos;s an example .
and when i went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago , i saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our scratch software to create a game somewhat like this one , and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game , but also he wanted to do more .
they &apos;re relevant for all sorts of different activities .
coding isn &apos;t just for computer whizzes , says mitch resnick of mit media lab -- it &apos;s for everyone . in a fun , demo-filled talk resnick outlines the benefits of teaching kids to code , so they can do more than just &quot; read &quot; new technologies -- but also create them . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
we work in clay , which hasn &apos;t changed much since michelangelo started screwing around with it , and there &apos;s a very interesting analogy to that too .
we &apos;re trying to find the beauty in the truth .
we have to have a shared intimacy , a shared vision -- that means we have to work as one family ; we have to understand ourselves that way .
we wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for bmw .
however , the engineers back in munich had taken on this kind of newtonian solution , and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin , and , you know , these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer .
i went fucking ballistic , right ? i went nuts .
actually , we all broke down into tears , to be quite honest about it , because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them , not being able to show me what i wanted , and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come .
yet comparatively , we have about a dozen targeted medications .
so we developed an idea , a rationale , that perhaps , if we made a molecule that prevented the post-it note from sticking by entering into the little pocket at the base of this spinning protein , then maybe we could convince cancer cells , certainly those addicted to this brd4 protein , that they &apos;re not cancer .
and he obliged us .
and in fact , this molecule prevents this adipocyte , this fat stem cell , from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet , like the folks in my hometown of chicago , fail to develop fatty liver , which is a major medical problem .
this research is funded by the public .
one big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time .
so part of our understanding of this was given to us by ludwig boltzmann , an austrian physicist in the 19th century .
one of the people who did understand that this was a problem was richard feynman .
because dark energy , unlike matter or radiation , does not dilute away as the universe expands .
he said , well , entropy increases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy .
that &apos;s the region where entropy is low .
it &apos;s cooling off .
either it &apos;s just like that . there is no explanation .
it was a simple machine that changed my life .
in malawi , the secondary school , you have to pay school fees .
and the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called ted .
rather than using it for my computer , i actually opened it .
what we are interested in is information .
so , technically , it &apos;s a little bit complex , but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use , in some sense .
i removed the microphone from that , and then just pinched that -- like i just made a clip out of the microphone -- and clipped that to a piece of paper , any paper that you found around .
pranav mistry : so , there are lots of companies -- actually sponsor companies of media lab -- interested in taking this ahead in one or another way .
it &apos;s a great honor to be here talking about cities , talking about the future of cities .
but with some original ways of getting things done , with some basic commandments , you can really get cities to be a great , great place to live .
cities are packed with people .
so remember what i said : you don &apos;t always have to be rich or powerful to get things done .
bring infrastructure to the favelas , to the slums , wherever you are .
this is osorio , he &apos;s our secretary of urban affairs .
let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks .
delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart , which is beauty .
the best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes .
beauty is nature &apos;s way of acting at a distance , so to speak .
i have in mind the so-called acheulian hand axes .
for us moderns , virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies , to express intense emotions with music , painting and dance .
we have already an autonomous vehicle .
one is , first of all , process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lanes of the road , there &apos;s the obstacles -- and convey this information to the driver .
so even though you are blind , you can put your hand over it , you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles .
dh : so since we started this project , we &apos;ve been getting hundreds of letters , emails , phone calls from people from all around the world .
now appearances , of course , can be deceptive , and to an extent , this feisty , energetic persona of lecture-going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer , albeit a very well-crafted and convincing one .
and i always wish , at this point , the voice had said , &quot; she is digging her own grave . &quot;
many people have harmed me in my life , and i remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
so it &apos;s not all bad .
how will we be remembered in 200 years ?
if you look at the solar system , as we know it today , it has a few planets close to the sun . that &apos;s where we live .
staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years , finally came out onto the land . and then of course it had great -- much greater freedom , and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean .
and that , of course , that set back the progress of radio astronomy by about 20 years .
why aren &apos;t we doing it ? simply because nobody thought of it yet .
we transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful than it is today .
i mean , in retrospect , probably stupid questions , but things like , &quot; what &apos;s this caps lock key for ? &quot;
and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm , sort of glowing kind of mood light , all the way to a bright work light .
you know , there is some push and pull , but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out .
but when nicholas negroponte -- and he has spoken about this project a lot , he &apos;s the founder of olpc -- came to us about two and a half years ago , there were some clear ideas .
some of you might have heard about the new york city condom .
i was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree .
so with deep humility , and for your approval , we present &quot; cloudburst . &quot;
among those who &apos;ve helped open my eyes to a third way are : a devout muslim in afghanistan , a group of harmonizing lesbians in croatia and a taboo breaker in liberia .
we are not flowers , we are sparks of change . &quot;
and after he would leave , women and girls would stay behind .
after the war , lots of these songs were lost , but they are a part of our childhood and our history , and we should not forget them . &quot;
but no , for the protest , they dressed all in white , no makeup .
when she made her presidential address , she acknowledged these brave women of liberia who allowed her to win against a football star -- that &apos;s soccer for you americans -- no less .
we can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou , and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers .
if you ever need one , just carry one of these .
so how are we doing this in the lab ?
and meanwhile , besides all the spirituality , there was one mundane detail in the kaaba that was pretty interesting for me .
seclusion of women was actually a byzantine and persian practice , and muslims adopted that and made that a part of their religion .
and we see truly in some muslim communities that tradition .
but besides that , i also saw problems within islamic tradition .
similarly , in the arab world , there was what the great arab historian albert hourani defines as the liberal age .
so in the 20th century , you had this vicious cycle in the arab world where you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people including the islamic-pious , and they &apos;re reacting in reactionary ways .
and they did not turn out to be the islamist boogyman that the dictators were always using to justify their regime .
and up until a little more than a century ago , nobody was able to do that with the brain .
and so coming back to the brain , this is from a genetically engineered mouse called &quot; brainbow . &quot;
yet , not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago , but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict .
the highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between 1998 and 2001 , with about 80,000 soldiers , policemen and rebels killed every year .
but for many parts of africa , a colleague of mine once put it this way , &quot; the cease-fire on tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on wednesday morning . &quot;
rather , local leaders committed to revisiting them later on .
diplomacy needs to be well resourced , sustained , and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers .
and one of those i &apos;d like to share with you today .
and they changed the atmosphere .
life turned hard so it could venture inland .
but there were witnesses , survivors in the dark .
but that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again .
so in australia , &quot; mo &quot; is slang for mustache , so we renamed the month of november &quot; movember &quot; and created some pretty basic rules , which still stand today .
so my lesson that year was persistence .
i &apos;ve heard this before . i know how it goes .
now what i want to share with you is one of my most touching movember moments , and it happened here in toronto last year , at the end of the campaign .
now to the funds we raise , and research , and how we &apos;re redefining research .
we wanted to share our stories with each other .
he &apos;s created a cooperative to help people diversify their livelihoods .
you know more than benki knew when he left his forest and went 3,000 miles .
today there are still three million hiv-positive people in india .
our dream is for our partners , our husbands , not to be given to us because of a horoscope , because they &apos;ve been tested for hiv . &quot;
but he doesn &apos;t want his nation ever to forget .
we can look at what they &apos;ve done , if we look .
&apos;my world &apos; tells us why the sun rises , why we were born .
and they both laughed .
bharat also conquered the world .
because it has to end .
take a look .
you see , this is what india is today . the ground reality is based on a cyclical world view .
but nobody was interested in listening to it , you see , until i met kishore biyani of the future group .
because you don &apos;t know whether you &apos;re right or wrong , and so all you seek is divine empathy .
who sees it all ?
so , for example , one of your great excuses is , &quot; well , great careers are really and truly , for most people , just a matter of luck , so i &apos;m going to stand around , i &apos;m going to try to be lucky , and if i &apos;m lucky , i &apos;ll have a great career . if not , i &apos;ll have a good career . &quot;
you know what ? you &apos;ll succeed . the world will give you the opportunity to work really , really , really , really hard , but are you so sure that that &apos;s going to give you a great career when all the evidence is to the contrary ?
i have a friend , proposed to his sweetie .
what do you want me to say ?
you know what you &apos;re going to say ?
how can you be one without the other ?
fortunately , her lump proved to be benign .
the next category is scattered fibroglandular densities , followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense .
but it &apos;s the exact opposite in health care .
it &apos;s made not of a bulky tube , but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector .
but the mbi image shows that tumor much more clearly , as well as a second tumor , which profoundly influence that patient &apos;s surgical options .
mri generates over a thousand .
mammography isn &apos;t perfect , but it &apos;s the only test that &apos;s been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer .
we &apos;ve got to get our hero , captain willard , to the mouth of the nung river so he can go pursue colonel kurtz .
now i see some puzzled looks like , &quot; why are you asking us what &apos;s the right thing to do ?
or should we leave him alone ?
and maybe , if we want to be on surer footing , what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there , that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place , and how would we know in a given situation what to do .
it &apos;s an objective truth about the form of two , the abstract form .
maybe there &apos;s another way that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework .
but maybe you don &apos;t feel that way either .
i know ; i spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence , trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us , that could give us answers .
what you just did , that &apos;s the first step towards taking responsibility for what we should do with all of our power .
now it &apos;s also a beautiful opera , and we &apos;re moved by that opera .
so anyway , even if i do not understand science entirely , for my design i essentially refer to it .
so when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shelter , preserved from noise pollution .
anyway , in this same kind of approach , i designed k .
you have to know that today , roughly one or two every drug pills is not taken correctly .
this one is a &quot; third lung , &quot; a pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment .
and he told me , after a long silence , &quot; i wonder , mathieu , if people won &apos;t be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos . &quot;
so your sofa , your plastic chair , your kid &apos;s toys give their own invisible reality . and this one is very toxic .
and you make some sushis with a fish and the aromatic plants above .
i guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig i was .
you couldn &apos;t sell cocaine .
my co-author , sudhir venkatesh , is the main character .
he was such a freak -- and that clipboard probably saved his life , because they figured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard .
i don &apos;t know if any of you know very much about org charts , but if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified mcdonald &apos;s org chart , this is exactly what the org chart would look like .
now if you managed to rise up -- say , and be that local leader , the guy who &apos;s the equivalent of the mcdonald &apos;s franchisee -- you &apos;d be making 100,000 dollars a year .
so in some very literal way , the young black men who were growing up in this country were living in a war zone , very much in the sense of the way that the soldiers over in iraq are fighting in a war .
it wasn &apos;t his money , until he spent it . and then essentially he was in debt to the gang , and was sort of an indentured servant for a while .
so that &apos;s exactly the same concept .
you can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board , there is a lot of force , a lot of power .
extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step , if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge .
what is the -- there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit . was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing ?
in the studio we do a lot of experiments .
i also put a mirror in the ceiling , and some fog , some haze .
and it &apos;s on the other side also , i think , quite beautiful , as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas , in these different places of the world .
it &apos;s quite simple and fundamental .
so if i have a sense of the space , if i feel that the space is tangible , if i feel there is time , if there is a dimension i could call time , i also feel that i can change the space .
the kraken , a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales , and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island .
i think that &apos;s got to be scaring a lot of animals away .
yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we &apos;ve spent on space exploration .
nathalia crane was a little girl from brooklyn .
it is to explain death to a child , and it deserves a piece of plain-song music . &quot;
natalie merchant sings from her new album , &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; leave your sleep . &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; lyrics from near-forgotten 19th-century poetry pair with her unmistakable voice for a performance that brought the audience to its feet .
and you can &apos;t get more alien than the dolphin .
on a good day , it &apos;s music , and i want to talk a little bit about the most amazing music-making experience i ever had .
i lost it when i saw that clip .
next user group are the dolphins at the national aquarium .
thirty years ago , we turned it on .
so we &apos;ll need something like c3po to become a translator between ourselves and some of the other machines we live with .
ng : so this is scalable video infrastructure , not for a few to a few but many to many , so that it scales to symmetrical video sharing and content sharing across these sites around the planet .
most of the time , i make posters , i post them on facebook , my friends like it , don &apos;t like it , most of the time don &apos;t like it , don &apos;t share it , don &apos;t nothing , and it &apos;s another day .
tell the iranians we from israel love you too . &quot;
&quot; lebanon ? &quot; &quot; lebanon . &quot;
this is a guy in tehran on the day of remembrance of the israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an israeli soldier on his page .
my name is ronny edry , and i &apos;m 41 , i &apos;m an israeli , i &apos;m a father of two , i &apos;m a husband , and i &apos;m a graphic designer . i &apos;m teaching graphic design .
we call this comic book &quot; yes is more , &quot; which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes .
and quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea .
and he said , &quot; shanghai is the city in the world with most skyscrapers , &quot; but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over .
that can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours .
and when she &apos;s gone , we &apos;re going to invite a chinese artist to reinterpret her .
the house is sort of a distortion of a square block .
so , the mountain is like our first built example of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy .
so we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem , exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants , and to use the thermal properties of water to heat and cool the buildings .
i &apos;m just going to list some of them .
but we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
there are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the sizes .
and then you ask , why economists ?
it &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
so i &apos;d like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
and treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very cheaply ?
so the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
thank you .
i &apos;m not saying people in the emerging markets don &apos;t understand democracy , nor am i saying that they wouldn &apos;t ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders .
now this is something that people can see and point to .
what might that world look like ?
because ultimately , the question before us , and the question before seven billion people on the planet is , how can we create prosperity ?
it was a little bit too funky , and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way -- fashion .
he says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant , the unconscious .
this is a project we &apos;re working on right now with a very healthy deadline .
so as a fashion designer , i &apos;ve always tended to think of materials something like this , or this , or maybe this .
you don &apos;t have to do anything to it ; you just literally watch it grow .
what i &apos;m looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that i need .
suzanne lee .
xiao jin : &quot; now , after i get off work , i study english , because in the future , our customers won &apos;t be only chinese , so we must learn more languages . &quot;
their calculations are different .
six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair .
but i &apos;m curious . if you had a minute , say , with apple &apos;s head of manufacturing , what would you say ?
i spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bombers and with taliban recruiters , trying to understand how the taliban were converting these children into live ammunition and why these children were actively signing up to their cause .
step two : they teach the children the koran , which is islam &apos;s holiest book , in arabic , a language these children do not understand and cannot speak .
he killed 22 .
and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers , and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface , but we weren &apos;t really sure .
if you went and looked for images of the internet , this was all that you found , this famous image by opte of the internet as the kind of milky way , this infinite expanse where we don &apos;t seem to be anywhere on it .
and i was embarrassed . i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for .
and he is english . the undersea cable industry is dominated by englishmen , and they all seem to be 42 .
and it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud , but every time we put something on the cloud , we give up some responsibility for it .
and it will change and disrupt the landscape of manufacturing , and most certainly our lives , our businesses and the lives of our children .
we can have 3d printers today that build structures like these .
you can &apos;t create this with standard manufacturing techniques even if you tried to do it manually .
you can use software like google sketchup to create products from scratch very easily .
and you can start iterating the design .
you know , this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree .
and that &apos;s the reason why , for hundreds of years , muslims everywhere have named their children jihad , their daughters as much as their sons , in the same way that , say , christians name their daughters grace , and hindus , my people , name our daughters bhakti , which means , in sanskrit , spiritual worship .
why do you keep using the word jihad in your friday sermons ?
but if you look closely , they &apos;re not fighting a global jihad .
what are those lessons ? we know who killed bin laden : seal team six .
we don &apos;t have to reinvent the wheel .
because really , it &apos;s a condition about choice , and the lack of freedom .
and when she turned 20 , found herself pregnant with a second child , her mom died and her husband left her -- married another woman .
so she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage -- of the total value , or about 400 dollars in savings .
thank you .
now is my book the next great american novel ?
that got me very excited .
i &apos;m glad you heard earlier today , batteries are unbelievably energy -- lack of density compared to fuel .
i &apos;ll be very short on genetic algorithms .
so we took a look at another idea .
but after the stirling engine , otto came along , and also , he didn &apos;t invent the internal combustion engine , he just refined it .
that &apos;s basically the most fundamental heat engine you could possibly have .
so this is the engine .
and you also get hot water .
it just affects the payback period if you &apos;re comparing to grid-supplied electricity .
but , everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it &apos;s so cheap .
the weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene .
we have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements .
and i &apos;m also trying to have some meals , and have some snacks , and , you know , and yell at my children , and do all the normal things that keep you grounded .
and so some of the things -- i mean , it was a long history of m &amp; amp ; co , and clearly we also needed to make some money , so we decided we would create a series of products .
so , i get to put in all of the things that i love .
you know , in the course of my life , i never know what &apos;s going to happen and that &apos;s kind of the beauty part .
so , once a month for the last year , i &apos;ve been doing a column called &quot; the principles of uncertainty , &quot; which , you know , i don &apos;t know who heisenberg is , but i know i can throw that around now . you know , it &apos;s the principles of uncertainty , so , you know .
so , shot dead , smacked over the head , you know , thrown away .
it is february and not lying is impossible . &quot;
gershwin died at the age of 38 .
td : from the time i was very young , onward , i was given a lot of different responsibilities , and it always seemed to me , when i was young , that everything was laid out before me .
and in terms of other things that i wanted to share with you , in terms of ideas , i think it &apos;s wonderful to have a situation like this , where so many people from different backgrounds and places can come together , exchange their ideas and form relationships of friendship with each other .
so i think the way forward for the world -- one that will bring the path of outer development in harmony with the real root of happiness -- is that we allow the information that we have to really make a change in our heart .
let &apos;s see what evolution can do for us .
that &apos;s what happened when the robots actually are rewarded for doing something .
but we &apos;re now up to 55 countries in the world , have had this virus emerge , in either birds , or people or both .
how do you get the vaccines moved around the world and the drugs moved , and whatever may or not be available that would work .
so what have people been doing with this money ?
let &apos;s see , should we order that all pets be kept indoors ?
or can we get away with some different kinds of masks ?
the federal government abdicated most responsibility .
so what does that mean for you ? well the first thing is , i wouldn &apos;t start building up personal stockpiles of anything -- for yourself , your family , or your employees -- unless you &apos;ve really done your homework .
happy to take your questions .
lg : right . so i have for a long time said that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic .
and along comes pneumococcus or another bacteria , streptococcus and boom , they get a bacterial pneumonia .
this motor has enough power to take you up the hills of san francisco at about 20 miles per hour , about 30 kilometers an hour , and this battery , this battery right here has about six miles of range , or 10 kilometers , which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the u.s. alone .
for an hour and a half i shared with the audience a lifetime of creativity , how i pursue perfection , how i cheat the impossible .
you cannot do that in two seconds and have a minuscule part of the card showing .
and he finally asked , &quot; can i see those ? &quot;
intuition is a tool essential in my life .
but it is too late .
and i thought it would be incredible if in the middle of the wire i stopped and , like a magician , i produce a dove and send her in the sky as a living symbol of peace .
they must think this guy with this dove , he must have spent years working with him .
by inspiring ourselves we inspire others .
one of the reasons i tell you about ants is because of my husband , who is in fact an ant taxonomist and when we got married , he promised to name an ant after me , which he did -- procryptocerus nalini , a canopy ant .
so , recolonization is really very slow .
and my feeling is -- thank you .
they ended up making a cd which they took home to their family and friends , thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium .
and our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in washington state and oregon .
if any of the more rowdier children questioned the authority of the parents , they were scolded .
they want a say in decisions that are made in their name and with their money . it &apos;s this democratization of information that i think is an information enlightenment , and it has many of the same principles of the first enlightenment .
so if any of you out there like the sound of that and have a law like that in your country , i know that seb would love to hear from you about collaborating and getting that into your country .
i want to see why do you -- you just say so ? that &apos;s not good enough .
they &apos;re watching all of us . they &apos;ve dug a basement , and they &apos;ve built a spy center to try and run algorithms and figure out which ones of us are troublesome , and if any of us complain about that , we &apos;re arrested for terrorism .
i had to focus all my energies towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral reefs .
if you were to go down to a depth of about 130 feet , which is the recommended limit for most scuba divers , you get this pressure effect .
so , this is how i began , about 15 years ago .
they allow you to mechanically breathe , or mechanically ventilate .
you need voting logic .
these are crinoids , sponges , black corals . there &apos;re some more fishes .
now , you &apos;ve seen video like this on tv a lot , and it &apos;s very intimidating , and i think it gives the wrong impression about sharks .
and i remember coming up from one of these deep dives , and i had this fog , and the narcosis takes a little while to , you know , fade away .
this is the second extraordinary photograph i &apos;m going to show you .
when i was 10 years old , a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school .
i &apos;d like to tell you about one such child , whose story was also covered by abc news .
and all this by simply watching the child &apos;s brainwaves .
we were the first film crew in there .
you know he &apos;d be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him .
in 30 , 50 years back , it was nothing , only paddy fields , and since we invited him here , he felt that he has got a responsibility .
the story of humans is the story of ideas -- scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners , ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally , ideas for which we &apos;ve lived and died and killed and been killed , ideas that have vanished in history , and ideas that have been set in dogma .
so , what exactly is seti ?
these extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments .
it &apos;s only the last few hundred thousand years modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization .
and no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water .
so , we have a fulfillment problem .
the ice of antarctica glows with a light so dazzling , it blinds the unprotected eye .
but under the surface is a hive of industrial activity periodically , this drill , like a biopsy needle , plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and isotopes for analysis .
don &apos;t we already know how they affect temperatures ?
lee hotz : inside an antarctic time machine
now , there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil .
now , in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollars : half of it to retool the car , truck and plane industries ; half of it to build the advanced bio-fuel industry .
let me focus a minute on the light vehicles , the cars and light trucks , because we all know the most about those ; probably everybody here drives one .
and when you make them light in the right way , that can be simpler and cheaper to make .
or we could , of course , just get this little bit by continuing to import some canadian and mexican oil , or the ethanol the brazilians would love to sell us .
those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive .
please download your copy , and thank you very much .
thank you frans de waal , wherever you are , i love you and i &apos;d give anything to meet you .
i &apos;d like to play you some voices of little girls from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did -- actually , some of the voices are more recent .
the reason i &apos;m showing you this is i &apos;m hoping that the scene that i &apos;m going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar , now that you &apos;ve listened to some girls &apos; voices .
but you get the general idea of the product .
hitler had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any .
his american interrogators described him as an amicable psychopath .
so i want to suggest that pleasure is deep -- and that this isn &apos;t true just for higher level pleasures like art , but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences .
it &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more pleasurable , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way .
after she got it , &quot; she was happy to report that she has discovered that he possessed a double who was rich , virile , handsome and aristocratic . &quot;
that drops the value of it , suggesting that that &apos;s one reason why we like it .
this is marla olmstead who did most of her work when she was three years old .
but what i want to point out is you can buy this from itunes .
why do we like an original painting better than a forgery ? psychologist paul bloom argues that human beings are essentialists -- that our beliefs about the history of an object change how we experience it , not simply as an illusion , but as a deep feature of what pleasure is .
so what i &apos;m going to show you is all of the main things , all of the main features of my discipline -- evidence-based medicine .
this is a headline from the daily telegraph in the u.k .
so i &apos;m going to tell you about one trial , which is probably the most well-reported trial in the u.k. news media over the past decade .
it &apos;s about the cultural meaning of a treatment .
so people set about doing trials of these new drugs against the old drugs , but they gave the old drugs in ridiculously high doses -- 20 milligrams a day of haloperidol .
so they &apos;re less likely to be randomly false positives , randomly false negatives .
the nordic cochrane group were trying to get a hold of the data on that to bring it all together .
how can i understand those invisible forces ? &quot;
nothing . they don &apos;t talk about us . they don &apos;t talk about the coal .
and sometimes you even watch satellite , cnn , from the united states .
and they have big cities , and the cities are all dependent on oil .
you can &apos;t help but think that .
they &apos;re there to build schools and help people , and that &apos;s what they want to do .
you feel frightened . of course you feel frightened .
you don &apos;t know that .
but some of you do .
now , put yourself in the shoes , go back to the shoes of an arab muslim living in iraq .
can you go there ?
listen to other people , enlighten ourselves .
in 1990 , exports from china to the united states : 15 billion dollars .
he said , &quot; he who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself , without lessening mine .
for the hollywood people in the audience , this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies : it &apos;s because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures , so the market for those movies is larger .
how many ramanujans are there in india today toiling in the fields , barely able to feed themselves , when they could be feeding the world ?
twentieth century : a little bit over two percent .
oil . oil . this was a big topic .
after two days here , i declare myself boggled , and enormously impressed , and feel that you are one of the great hopes -- not just for american achievement in science and technology , but for the whole world .
yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures .
nowadays , in addressing microbial biodiversity , scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the pacific ocean .
i is for the invasive species like the fire ants , the zebra mussels , broom grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country , and at an exponential rate -- that &apos;s the i .
i wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of earth &apos;s biodiversity .
we didn &apos;t really realize that until 1914 , when the last passenger pigeon , a female named martha , died at the cincinnati zoo .
and the aurochs was like the bison .
the passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome .
and national geographic got interested because national geographic has the theory that the last century , discovery was basically finding things , and in this century , discovery is basically making things .
so now we go to mike mcgrew who is a scientist at roslin institute in scotland , and mike &apos;s doing miracles with birds .
captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species .
so ben novak , even as we speak , is joining the group that beth shapiro has at uc santa cruz .
throughout humankind &apos;s history , we &apos;ve driven species after species extinct : the passenger pigeon , the eastern cougar , the dodo ... but now , says stewart brand , we have the technology to bring back species that humanity wiped out . so -- should we ? which ones ? he asks a big question whose answer is closer than you may think .
a published author of books came to talk to us about what he did for a living .
i went from having art once a week to twice a month to once a month to not at all .
and i thought , &quot; oh no . he thinks it &apos;s a note . &quot;
mark lynch , he &apos;s an amazing teacher and he &apos;s still a dear friend of mine , and i was 14 or 15 , and i walked into his comic book class halfway through the course , and i was so excited , i was beaming .
and i said , &quot; yes , i have a job . i write and illustrate children &apos;s books . &quot;
for a two-year-old , that is like a tattoo .
that &apos;s true . you are alive , and that &apos;s pretty good right now .
i think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero , wouldn &apos;t we ? and yet , as noise levels go up , so do the errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals .
in a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds , which is pretty common , this is what it sounds like .
what does it cost to treat a classroom down to that 0.4-second reverberation time ?
my friend richard mazuch , an architect in london , coined the phrase &quot; invisible architecture . &quot;
because , if you look closely enough , things will begin to appear .
and in austin , texas , i was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon .
and zero wants to go to the moon .
natasha tsakos presents part of her one-woman , multimedia show , &quot; upwake . &quot; as the character zero , she blends dream and reality with an inventive virtual world projected around her in 3d animation and electric sound .
then , so , before breakfast , you &apos;ve already met the pig so many times .
so , this is actually a healthier cigarette .
well , the last product from the book that i &apos;m showing you is renewable energy -- actually , to show that my first question , if pigs are still used up until the last bit , was still true .
they pay me to teach a lesson .
one year i came up with a bright idea .
you see , &quot; -18 &quot; sucks all the life out of you .
but it is not impossible .
it &apos;s the framework onto which the other parts are bolted .
how are these construals reflected in language ?
as when we say we &quot; gather &quot; our ideas , to &quot; put &quot; them &quot; into &quot; words , and if our words aren &apos;t &quot; empty &quot; or &quot; hollow , &quot; we might get these ideas &quot; across &quot; to a listener , who can &quot; unpack &quot; our words to &quot; extract &quot; their &quot; content . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why are bribes , polite requests , solicitations and threats so often veiled ?
on the other hand , you want the damn guacamole .
in an exclusive preview of his book &amp; lt ; i &amp; gt ; the stuff of thought &amp; lt ; / i &amp; gt ; , steven pinker looks at language and how it expresses what goes on in our minds -- and how the words we choose communicate much more than we realize .
even before that , what does it matter to me whether you have this idea that kant &apos;s theory works or mill &apos;s the right ethicist to follow ?
we want to have our defenses up and our strategies all in order .
and i say , &quot; well why do you believe p ? &quot;
in order to do that , well , i don &apos;t know how to do that .
and i &apos;m also thrilled to be in the foreplay section .
and so they still weren &apos;t getting it .
learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world -- that &apos;s the switch .
and it &apos;s carving things down from the top , with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product . you heat it up ; you beat it with high pressures ; you use chemicals . ok . heat , beat and treat .
a guy named jeff brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process .
in our fuel cells , we do it with platinum ; life does it with a very , very common iron .
we do chemistry in organic solvents .
thank you .
and it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs . so it &apos;s not mutually exclusive .
and she had turned it down , she said , because she was going to start her next business , an entrepreneurship consultancy that would teach business skills to men and women all around afghanistan .
and i said , &quot; just in case you &apos;re looking for entrepreneurs to feature at your next investment conference , here are a couple of women . &quot;
and she had come to washington , not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan .
now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons .
together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule .
whether storytellers realized it or not , they were channeling meggendorfer &apos;s spirit when they moved opera to vaudville , radio news to radio theater , film to film in motion to film in sound , color , 3d , on vhs and on dvd .
but can i use a paper towel ?
so first , we demolish it .
now , if i hadn &apos;t paid attention to embodied energy , it would have taken us over 50 years to break even compared to the upgraded house .
and after 10 years of this , my wife eventually said , &quot; look , you know , you gotta do this thing you &apos;ve been talking about , and build the vending machine . &quot;
but what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way .
it &apos;s pretty annoying for the fishermen .
parents seem to be teaching their young .
and we move to the third stage , where we only give them a coin .
or find expensive components from discarded electronics ?
but there &apos;s nothing you can do to compensate for the fact that we can pay $ 1.57 an hour in juarez , mexico . so we &apos;re leaving . &quot;
as we know , only half the states have opted in .
along the eastern seaboard , we &apos;re going to lead the nation in offshore wind .
i &apos;m going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love , or love to hate , are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender .
so the traditional media companies , of course , are paying very close attention to these online communities .
well , i actually don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be the case .
i can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms like they were songs of spring .
inside it , i will place a mockingbird for -- short explanation , hippie parents .
i &apos;ll listen for what &apos;s missing , and i &apos;ll put it there .
no . it was the whole , you know , motion .
it &apos;s like this . you trigger the spot .
nothing seemed to help .
anyway these women sat in front of an x-ray device .
so uh , okay .
and she said , you can &apos;t make that conclusion , because animals don &apos;t register pain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do .
and in fact he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out .
this truly is an at-risk population with very few resources to support them .
now up until that moment , i would have thought that , by age 50 , one of the life skills that i had really nailed was tying my shoes .
first of all -- any questions so far ?
it &apos;s actually a simple one , but it &apos;s a good one to start with .
and yeah , it &apos;s the sort of thing you produce when you &apos;re doodling on the phone .
but in the tidied up version , it &apos;s plain to see that it &apos;s a sunburnt woman playing volleyball .
tidying up rene magritte -- this is really fun .
or you could go into three-dimensional art .
and i started to bring some order into some flags .
and design was in everything my dad did .
it mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune , and it projects that message , that story , so strongly that it almost blots out anything else .
no , no , no , no , no .
but as a dysfunctional , as a dysfunctional murderer / psychotic , he &apos;s something much more complicated .
what a liberating thought ! yes !
listen to one of the design features of plato &apos;s government 4.0 : &quot; the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed , and the state in which they are most eager , the worst . &quot;
that won &apos;t do at all .
he would have loved those ! oh yeah .
it &apos;s something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times .
i was a hemiplegic , and back home in new york , i used a wheelchair for four years , all through college .
still , abed was far from my mind , when last year , i returned to israel to write of the crash , and the book i then wrote , &quot; half-life , &quot; was nearly complete when i recognized that i still wanted to meet abed , and finally i understood why : to hear this man say two words : &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
it was approaching 11 when i exited right toward afula , and passed a large quarry and was soon in kfar kara .
he had problems with his side and his legs too , and , oh , he &apos;d lost his teeth in the crash .
we looked up at the wreckage .
he was not a particularly bad man or a particularly good man .
i told him only that he had killed one man , not two .
and here is a little bit of the technology that &apos;s involved in that .
which was the basis of the movie &quot; bladerunner . &quot;
it &apos;s changed my life .
here &apos;s my approach to it all .
or some even included references to the speakers , such as nathan myhrvold &apos;s speaking style , or the one of tim ferriss , which might be considered a bit strenuous at times .
and finally also , i never understood this , some people really came up with their own version of the truth .
and i would only pay $ 99.50 -- so stay even below a hundred dollars for it .
finally , in part three , i &apos;m going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation , which will pull all the pieces of the story together .
when the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up , look at what they found .
but string theory says that , on fantastically small scales , there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them .
which means we have been asking the wrong question .
and when it comes to planets and their distances , this clearly is the right kind of reasoning .
the inflationary theory already has strong observational support .
the range of ideas you &apos;ve just spoken about are dizzying , exhilarating , incredible .
now , i &apos;ll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick , but it &apos;s a trick that actually works .
by the way , if you are a boy , it &apos;s snails ; if you &apos;re a girl , it &apos;s butterflies because what we found was that girls hate snails .
pm : no . that &apos;s the wrong thing to do .
female voice : see if you can inspire him to do any better .
female voice : why don &apos;t you try saying something encouraging to cheer milo up .
but for me , this is a wonderful opportunity where technology , at last , can be connected with , where i am no longer restrained by the finger i hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game &apos;s concerned -- or by the blandness of not being noticed if you &apos;re watching a film or a book .
i had the honor of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege , and i say i have the honor and the privilege of being there because it &apos;s taught me everything , not just about being a reporter , but about being a human being .
between april and august , 1994 , one million people were slaughtered .
but there will always be another war . &quot;
actually , the first time we recorded more than one neuron -- a hundred brain cells simultaneously -- we could measure the electrical sparks of a hundred cells in the same animal , this is the first image we got , the first 10 seconds of this recording .
think about that .
and in just four weeks , the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway -- like a new sense .
well , in an experiment that we ran a few years ago , we took this to the limit .
miguel nicolelis : a monkey that controls a robot with its thoughts . no , really .
she still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors .
in the 19th century , it was slavery .
from one to five , girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate than boys , in all of india .
so what would some of the specific challenges look like ?
the baby died , and she ended up with a fistula .
she was beaten every single day by her husband , who was unemployed .
they made a donation to an organization based in arkansas called heifer international .
a few yards away was a failed chicken coop .
and so the question becomes : how do we discharge that responsibility ?
and that is how and why did this remarkable trait evolve , and why did it evolve only in our species ?
and even this picture has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it -- something from a barnum &amp; amp ; bailey circus .
and so some time around 200,000 years ago , our species confronted this crisis .
but he looks at the pile of arrowheads , thinks they &apos;re a gift , picks them up , smiles and walks off .
currently , there are about seven or 8,000 different languages spoken on earth .
because these different languages impose a barrier , as we &apos;ve just seen , to the transfer of goods and ideas and technologies and wisdom .
matt ridley : mark , one question .
it was a critical moment in american history and global history where one felt they didn &apos;t have access to accurate information .
and they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they &apos;re hoping for .
and playboy is always in the top few .
essentially they &apos;ve simulated a city for urban combat , and this is one of the structures that exists in that city .
and a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory , if there ever was an actual memory .
i photographed ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the oakland a &apos;s to play professional baseball just before his conviction .
before that time , people are left to their own devices .
okay . so maybe i would take this whole idea and go to private corporations that would have this mutually shared benefit to it , but i was quickly told by some corporations that my personal passion project was not a brand fit because they didn &apos;t want their logos stamped across the ghettos of haiti .
it was an astronomy book , and i poured over that thing for hours on end , and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream , and part of that dream was , i always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft .
and i mention this because there &apos;s this strange public perception that nasa &apos;s dead , that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there &apos;s no more spacecraft out there .
there &apos;s a point to be made here .
we are wired to pursue happiness , not only to enjoy it , but to want more and more of it .
and freud in part reflects the anatomy of the human emotion system -- which is that we have both a positive and a negative system , and our negative system is extremely sensitive .
and that isn &apos;t true -- when you get less miserable , you get less miserable .
and it starts in the ventral tegmental area .
there is something very restorative about nature , and it &apos;s part of how we are tuned .
there &apos;s attachment , which is oxytocin , and the opiates , which says , &quot; this is a long-term bond . &quot;
that whole dopamine-wanting system takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system .
africa was truly fascinating for me .
now why would you use rats ?
but with this small investment in a rat capacity , we have demonstrated in mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter , we do it at $ 1.18 , and we can still bring that price down .
an animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent , so it goes extremely fast .
to conclude , i would actually like to say , you may think this is about rats , these projects , but in the end it is about people .
today i &apos;ll talk about a different approach , which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain , and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain .
if you go back in time about &#91; 75,000 &#93; to 100,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago .
well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got receptors in your skin , touch and pain receptors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re not being touched .
vilayanur ramachandran : the neurons that shaped civilization
that little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube , and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another morina flower , just on the right species , what happens ?
that tells me that it &apos;s actually been fossilized , this pollen .
and murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing , certainly in the u.k. , to within an area that &apos;s small enough that you can send in tracker dogs to find the murder victim .
and you see the female line since 1984 , the gap is widening .
that has to happen in heart disease , and it &apos;s time .
and every woman in the room here has benefited from that women &apos;s health initiative .
some women have those heart attacks , but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack , where it erodes , doesn &apos;t completely fill with clot , symptoms are subtle , ekg findings are different -- female-pattern .
so that was a discovery .
and when you have female-pattern and you look like a woman , as barbara does here with her husband , they don &apos;t get the treatment .
we &apos;re bending the curve .
women &apos;s health , from a federal funding standpoint , sometimes it &apos;s popular , sometimes it &apos;s not so popular .
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive .
in a sense , tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here , because structural engineers build bridges and big things , computer engineers , computers , but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves .
okay .
dr : he sure nailed it , didn &apos;t he .
so welcome to my home .
and now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in , and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that co-occurred with an instance of water .
and we get this wordscape , except now words are not assembled in my living room .
this is a pro-amateur , or pro-am media critic who has this high fan-out rate .
my mother &apos;s in the kitchen , cooking , and , of all places , in the hallway , i realize he &apos;s about to do it , about to take more than two steps .
so this year we &apos;re going to visualize how the brain visualizes .
it &apos;s the kind of gut center , where you see an image and you go , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever i &apos;m seeing . &quot;
and , by the way , this is the way in which we develop and formulate strategy within autodesk , in some of our organizations and some of our divisions .
all these houses are built from between 70 and 80 percent recycled material , stuff that was headed to the mulcher , the landfill , the burn pile .
this is a bathtub i made , made out of scrap two-by-four here .
so if you put it in the front door , your design fails .
if i took a bite out of it , you &apos;d go , &quot; wait a second .
on the other end of the spectrum , we have a dionysian perspective , which is more given to the passions and intuition , tolerant of organic texture and human gesture .
if you buy a two-by-four and it &apos;s not straight , you can take it back .
the problem is we can &apos;t afford it .
we buy stuff we didn &apos;t know we needed .
sure enough , we all buy into that , and with gated communities , we have a formalized expectation with a homeowners association .
and we &apos;re taking vanity and shoving it down here .
what do you think , honey ? &quot;
and if you look , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s only one way you can score three .
while i was producing in los angeles , i never thought about it for a second .
so what you &apos;d be wondering , watching the human show , is are we going to confront and address the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way by growing our consciousness , or are we going to continue to retreat ?
and during that process -- it took many years -- one of the doctors said that my recovery , my degree of advance , since the amount of head injury i &apos;d suffered , was miraculous .
then i underwent cognitive training .
he then held my jaw in the right position while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment .
all consciousness is about communication .
and when i came out of my coma , i recognized my family , but i didn &apos;t remember my own past .
simon lewis : i knew when i was timing this that there wouldn &apos;t be time for me to do anything about -- well this is it . this is the control unit .
i should clarify that .
i did also an unethical study of the professors of the karolinska institute -- that hands out the nobel prize in medicine , and they are on par with the chimpanzee there .
your yellow ones here are the arabic countries , and they get larger families , but they -- no , longer life , but not larger families .
the problem in the world was the poverty in asia . and if i now let the world move forward , you will see that while population increase , there are hundreds of millions in asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty , and this is the pattern we have today .
this is mao tse-tung . he brought health to china . and then he died .
and the public is there , and the internet is there , but we have still not used it effectively .
the income distribution of the united states , 1970 .
in back of me is a picture of me when i was 17 .
and so when i got my ph.d. , i should go and search for dna .
so wilkins said he thought it was the helix .
and i read it , and it was just -- it was crap .
so i changed the locations , and then we found the base pairing , and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions .
he was one of the members . the question was : how do you go from a four-letter code to the 20-letter code of proteins ?
so the dna is really badly mucked up , whereas if you have a chance of surviving , the dna isn &apos;t so mucked up .
and so , i &apos;ll conclude by saying we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
and as a result , the patent troll can claim that they won the case .
now , as mentioned before , one of the reasons i can talk to you about this is because there &apos;s no non-disclosure agreement on this case .
and the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have different outcomes in mind for the patent system .
it was off and running before i could even blink my eyes , but even if i could have slowed down those girls , i wouldn &apos;t have , because one thing that i have learned from over a decade of working with girls is that they already know what they need .
because that &apos;s what they called them .
he &apos;s even here today .
these are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before , and then two days later , they can no longer breathe , and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs , but also their breathing muscles .
and in both cases , we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses , and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries .
now we don &apos;t have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this , to eradicating diseases .
these people , these 20 million people , vaccinate over 500 million children every single year , multiple times at the peak of our operation .
but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , irrespective of geography , poverty , culture and even conflict .
he got 100 percent in all the important things , like nursery rhymes , for example there .
the first place this vaccine was used was in southern afghanistan , because it &apos;s in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this .
and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years .
that &apos;s what it costs to reach 500 million children .
beverly &apos;s clearly one of them , and this little leopard , legadema , is another , and she changed our lives .
but we &apos;ve managed to find that these lions are 15 percent bigger than any others , and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water .
sleep deprivation is extreme .
it was phenomenal , and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent .
they ended up sleeping for hours .
i call it complacency -- our complacency .
bj / dj : thank you very much .
after all , it seems obvious that the earth is large and motionless , the sun small and mobile . but it &apos;s worth recalling wittgenstein &apos;s remark on the subject .
then , general stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office . stubblebine , who commanded 16,000 soldiers , was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall .
whatever you are , therefore , you are not the stuff of which you are made .
now , there &apos;s another fatty acid , capric acid , which is just like the other two , except that it has two more carbon atoms .
and when i say quite common , it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounters another , which is a sad thought .
biologist richard dawkins makes a case for &quot; thinking the improbable &quot; by looking at how the human frame of reference limits our understanding of the universe .
this technology allows me to remain engaged , mentally active , and feel like i am a part of the world .
one of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop .
with the help of people like you , we can make this dream a reality .
devices like the cymascope , which you can see here , have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns .
and here is some eye candy for you , from a range of diy scientists and artists from all over the globe .
that said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
and it specifically refers to this guy , galvao bueno , who &apos;s the lead soccer commentator for rede globo .
and again , that was very shocking to many twitter users , but it shouldn &apos;t be .
it turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits .
but look at this map , and you can watch this for , you know , two or three minutes .
a this is a map of articles in wikipedia that have been geo-coded .
the first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention .
and yeeyan is a group of 150,000 volunteers who get online every day .
not only does she have to keep our israeli and palestinian contributors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the middle east .
and so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this blacksmith in kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology , about innovating from constraint , about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials .
we have to fix our media .
they would bring prosperity , security , overcome sectarian violence , ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists .
it &apos;s not about the things that it brings .
if local democracy is to flourish , it is about the active and informed engagement of every citizen .
what is this ?
broccoli is not a chinese vegetable ; in fact , it is originally an italian vegetable .
and as this article points out , &quot; the average native of any city in china knows nothing of chop suey . &quot;
and as he said -- we would never print this today -- but basically , the american man has become very rich .
mcdonald &apos;s has , sort of , garnered a lot of attention , a lot of respect , for basically standardizing the menu , décor and dining experience in post-world war ii america .
but at some point , all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a chinese restaurant , and all these chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies , which , of course we know aren &apos;t even chinese to begin with .
i &apos;d like to do pretty much what i did the first time , which is to choose a light-hearted theme .
so , they went to the police and they said , &quot; we know that at the rome railroad station , there are all these lost souls wandering around , muttering gibberish . can you bring one of them to us ? &quot;
in the late &apos; 70s , early &apos; 80s , there were others , and they were very effective .
so , with the advice of my physician , i had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital .
remember when you were a kid , and you had to step on every line ?
again , not a single one of them -- i think there are about seven or eight of them -- thought this would do any good . they thought this was a temporary change .
well , you know , it &apos;s been a wonderful life .
if i , with the bleakness of spirit , with no spirit , that i had in the 1970s and no possibility of recovery , as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought , if i can find my way back from this , believe me , anybody can find their way back from any adversity that exists in their lives .
but it &apos;s not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities .
and whatever the short-run price for taking action on climate change or taking action on security , or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education , these are prices that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries .
i &apos;m just wondering how -- whether you can see that changing over time , whether you see in britain that there are changing attitudes , and that people are actually more supportive of the kind of global ethic that you talk about .
and you have politicians who have -- you &apos;re elected . in a way , you can &apos;t say that .
america has made its first disposition on this with the bill that president obama should be congratulated for getting through congress .
and god cried .
so the question is , how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia ?
so as you see the film go in transparently through there , and then ...
i mean , why would you want to do all these things for real ?
we &apos;re impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do , whether you want to replace a vein or a bone , or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics , perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt , maybe carry your drugs in your pocket , deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert , the answer may be in a thread of silk .
you can learn something from the robot about the community that you &apos;re in .
data : pretty lucky for them .
actually , as soon as someone turns it on , i go into the other room and read .
why strangeness ? because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data , and data turns our social relations into digital relations , and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness , a sense of discovery , a sense of surprise and unpredictability .
and yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat .
maria bezaitis : the surprising need for strangeness
i started working on my mother &apos;s signature , because my father &apos;s is absolutely impossible to forge .
i wanted to ask him questions , which he didn &apos;t answer .
it was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .
if he slept one hour , 30 people would die .
then as time passed , at the end of almost two years , they thought , &quot; well , perhaps our father has died . &quot;
all my childhood , while my friends &apos; dads would tell them grimm &apos;s fairy tales , my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes with unshakeable utopias who managed to make miracles .
this is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years .
it &apos;s not only carbon dioxide that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change .
you know , you don &apos;t want to stand there .
we don &apos;t transgress the climate boundary until the early &apos; 90s , actually , right after rio .
but again , a crisis , new partnerships , actors locally , transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning .
but of course , the drama is , it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option .
you know , i was born in brazil and grew up in the &apos; 70s under a climate of political distress , and i was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way -- in a sort of a semiotic black market .
the first works were actually objects .
&quot; the snail . &quot;
so this is a lighthouse .
and you render this with the most non-specific material , which is dust itself .
i was more interested in the things in between , you know , because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there .
but before doing that , i just briefly want to remind you about what you already know : that our genomes , our genetic material , are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes in the form of dna , which is this famous double-helical molecule .
yet the people inside africa have more genetic variation .
so we can relax the criterion a bit and say : how many positions do we find where 95 percent of people in africa have one variant , 95 percent another variant , and the number of that is 12 .
did we mix or not ?
so we can then ask for denisovans the same things as for the neanderthals : did they mix with ancestors of present day people ?
difficult question , simple answer : nothing .
so we combined these needs with technology &apos;s themes .
and nature builds large skeletons out of it .
we do that all the time . we just can &apos;t shake it off .
it doesn &apos;t . it begins with the beginning of life .
now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences .
and yet , the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years , and in disadvantaged populations , the populations that don &apos;t have access to clinical services , rural populations , minorities , the age of diagnosis is later still , which is almost as if i were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe .
those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds , and we freeze one frame , and this is what the typical children are doing .
now , we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children , but this would be for naught if we didn &apos;t have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community .
and you put on the t-10 parachute .
i &apos;m probably going to jump .
so you look around , where you &apos;re going to land , you try to make yourself ready .
this was my father in vietnam .
and instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them , i &apos;m now leading a force that &apos;s dispersed , and i &apos;ve got to use other techniques .
i asked , &quot; where were you on 9 / 11 ? &quot;
i probably learned the most about relationships .
you can get knocked down , and it hurts and it leaves scars .
and in the course of the exhibition -- which was contentious , controversial and ultimately , for me , life-changing in my sense of what art could be -- a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other .
after his lecture , a student got up and said to him , &quot; give us a poem . &quot;
it &apos;s also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it , and imagining , particularly in urban america , about the nurturing of the spirit .
after this , we noticed a couple of interesting things , which you &apos;ll see .
and he couldn &apos;t travel , so i went over there .
at that time , a large amount of money had come into newcastle university to improve schooling in india .
it &apos;s just been published in the british journal of educational technology .
in gateshead , i took 32 children and i started to fine-tune the method .
i have further results , which are almost unbelievable , of scores which go up with time .
this is what i &apos;m building now -- they &apos;re called soles : self organized learning environments .
text : in another 30 minutes they would reach the theory of relativity . and then ?
little did i know that it was mine as well .
you saw many examples of my work up there , but it &apos;s one that people know .
but the beauty of it is that it &apos;s just silk and sticks .
stephano : out of the moon , i do assure thee .
it becomes the rainstorm .
but it &apos;s very easy to climb up , is it not ?
my first introduction was at the abidjan airport on a sweaty , ivory coast morning .
so , one week , two weeks , three weeks went by , and finally i said , &quot; well , how about blue ? &quot;
and on a macro level -- some of the speakers have inferred that even health should be privatized .
and i really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so . because the company was literally 10 days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world-quality level needed to make coartem , when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history .
and , long story short , again , they &apos;ve been so successful .
we &apos;ve got to start having conversations like this , and i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any better way to start than using the market , but also to bring other people to the table around it .
some of you may recognize this image .
so we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using , divided between two floors .
and it &apos;s actually in the machine .
life can be messy .
in 1975 , i met in florence a professor , carlo pedretti , my former professor of art history , and today a world-renowned scholar of leonardo da vinci .
they &apos;re magnificent . you see leonardo at work .
and one day we hope that these tissues can serve as replacement parts for the human body .
but another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells is that if we take some skin cells , let &apos;s say , from people with a genetic disease and we engineer tissues out of them , we can actually use tissue-engineering techniques to generate models of those diseases in the lab .
it gives new meaning to models against animal testing , doesn &apos;t it ?
so , that &apos;s the stage out of all this . i find , for reasons i don &apos;t understand , i really do have a goal .
they are powered only by the energy they can extract from the atmosphere -- an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy .
pm : but now we &apos;re trying to get the video . there we go .
but like any basic research , when you &apos;re really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology , you can get there with micro-technology , nanotechnology .
and if this lands on you , i assure you it will not hurt you .
and anyone who &apos;s been bitten by the numbers bug knows that it bites early and it bites deep .
and today , i want to show you one of those musical notes , a number so beautiful , so massive , i think it will blow your mind .
a random odd number is a lot harder to test .
we didn &apos;t know for almost 40 years until frank nelson cole came along .
it is in telling the story of the mathematics .
if , when ted had begun , at 11 o &apos;clock on tuesday , we &apos;d walked out and simply hit one slide every second , it would have taken five hours to show you that number .
it can take a randomly shuffled rubik &apos;s cube .
that &apos;s what is so exciting for me about this prime number .
animals , just like humans , sometimes get strange tumors .
but in order for me to explain what that is , i need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself .
and when i looked at the sequence of the dna , and compared the sequence of jonas &apos; tumor to that of the rest of his body , i discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile .
and if you &apos;re squeamish , please look away now .
so just finally , cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments .
and we all think our kids will be especially talented .
so most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities .
next time reality would catch up with them .
they &apos;re actually more realistic than healthy individuals .
so for example , if someone said , &quot; my likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 50 percent , &quot; and we said , &quot; hey , good news .
and if your brain is failing at integrating bad news about the future , you will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on .
the british government , for example , has acknowledged that the optimism bias can make individuals more likely to underestimate the costs and durations of projects .
one is power transition , which is change of power amongst states .
if they have the price of entry into an internet cafe -- the last time i looked , it was something like a pound an hour -- and if you have skype , it &apos;s free .
but we need a new narrative if we &apos;re to understand power in the 21st century .
but be very careful about these projections such as the goldman sachs projection as though that gives you an accurate picture of power transition in this century .
let me give you an example from history .
power is multi-polar .
how do we produce global public goods , which are good for us , but good for everyone at the same time ?
that will produce a legitimate and accountable government .
the first is to recognize the interdependence of three key actors , who are different actors , and at the moment are uncoordinated .
elections produce a loser , who is then excluded .
so i &apos;m going to talk a little about each of them .
basically , prices soar and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector , but it doesn &apos;t generate any jobs .
you can use yardstick competition , so they have to compete against each other for the resources .
the focus on the basic service delivery through these independent service authorities would have rescued basic services from their catastrophic levels , and it would have given ordinary people the sense that the government was doing something useful .
and how will they cope in a foreign land ?
while it &apos;s true that many who died in katrina did not have access to transportation , others who did refused to leave as the storm approached , often because available transportation and shelters refused to allow them to take their pets .
here &apos;s just one example , san francisco airport , with 16 inches or more of flooding .
there are no quick fixes .
t : most importantly ... s : most importantly ...
s : i want to change my life !
indeed , if you score the people a century ago against modern norms , they would have an average i.q. of 70 .
now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews .
what color are the bears at the north pole ? &quot;
they put it in harrisburg rather than philadelphia .
so it hasn &apos;t just been the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
today we would say something like , well , imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized .
but by 1960 , people could attack raven &apos;s on a much more sophisticated level .
james flynn : why our iq levels are higher than our grandparents&apos;
and i &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
and she cleared such a space that i endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students , an empty space , whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding .
you know the one .
i wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
if al gore is here , i &apos;m going to send my fourth-graders from agnor-hurt and venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
i thought i was failing as a teacher . why would she do this ?
we all lose .
he says , &quot; how many zeros in a trillion ? i &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot;
and there are three seconds left on the clock .
lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the national movement .
it &apos;s a joint of tubes . you start by teaching angles -- an acute angle , a right angle , an obtuse angle , a straight angle .
now this is people science .
now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon .
here &apos;s a paper which you could &#91; unclear &#93; -- designed by a mathematician at harvard in 1928 , arthur stone , documented by martin gardner in many of his many books .
what we &apos;ve done , we &apos;ve just sealed both the ends with tape , nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner , so there &apos;s holes in the opposite corners , there &apos;s a little hole over here .
and we &apos;re just trying to see possibilities .
there are 12 million blind children in our country -- who live in a world of darkness .
and this is -- you can see -- this is a flapping bird .
suddenly there was a storm and huge waves .
and if we &apos;re to make progress with the sustainability revolution , i believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about .
with less steel we were getting more sunlight in , which meant we didn &apos;t have to put as much extra heat in winter .
graham wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this , turning waste streams into schemes that create value .
this is the namibian fog-basking beetle , and it &apos;s evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert .
so an important biomimicry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in symbiotic clusters .
the next thing is sodium chloride .
michael pawlyn : using nature &apos;s genius in architecture
that &apos;s only 2.3 percent of the population .
so obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward .
there were just bad for me .
i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points , and i ranked everything starting at 100 and going all the way down to 91 , and listing things like i was looking for somebody who was really smart , who would challenge and stimulate me , and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points .
i didn &apos;t carry on crazy catfish-style relationships with anybody .
and that &apos;s what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship .
in fact , it &apos;s something that you write yourself .
and i &apos;m almost sure most of you have thought , &quot; oh , come on , can &apos;t you do something more intelligent than shooting at zombies ? &quot;
so we &apos;re actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision , and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better .
but a few kids are sad and blue because they &apos;ve forgotten their coat .
what is multimedia-tasking ? it &apos;s the fact that most of us , most of our children , are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they &apos;re doing search on the web at the same time as they &apos;re chatting on facebook with their friends .
so that &apos;s really the crux of the research , and to do that , we need to go one more step .
who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli ?
so let &apos;s try changing the rule for this program a little bit .
i mean , we &apos;re used to having science let us predict things , but something like this is fundamentally irreducible .
let &apos;s say -- i don &apos;t know -- what &apos;s the gdp of spain ?
and i must say that i thought that step might just be plain impossible .
i think it &apos;s actually rather wonderful .
in a sense , we can use the computational universe to get mass customized creativity .
and i &apos;m not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is .
i think things like the rule 30 cellular automaton get us to a different level .
back in the day , computers used to fill this entire room , and people actually used to work inside the computers .
you might be wondering , who are these people ?
and if my mother ever questioned him , he beat her , abused her , and really it was difficult .
and the day before the actual ceremony happens , we were dancing , having excitement , and through all the night we did not sleep .
there is something about clothes , i think , and shoes .
&quot; my child , what are you doing here ? &quot;
as i went back , i started talking to the men , to the village , and mothers , and i said , &quot; i want to give back the way i had promised you that i would come back and help you . what do you need ? &quot;
now she &apos;s the best student , not just in our school , but in the entire division that we are in .
we &apos;ve questioned the future of capitalism .
there was nothing to buy , unless you wanted to buy some rivets . right ?
but that &apos;s not really the whole story .
the first cultural value shift that we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life .
another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of zynga .
gore-tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees , to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses .
perfect example of that is patagonia .
and what they found out is when that was available for public record , the people &apos;s electricity usage in those communities dropped .
and it &apos;s also become a very , very valuable sort of advertising revenue for j &amp; amp ; j as well .
and sometimes it comes down to something as simple as , their core wound is their father died without ever saying he &apos;s proud of them .
and i took my bike into the bike store-- i love this -- same bike , and they &apos;d do something called &quot; truing &quot; the wheels .
but before i go there , please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story .
we &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
now one other thing happened around this same time .
i watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today -- a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .
yet as much as i love stories , recently , i &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
we were three writers , one from the philippines , one turkish and one indonesian -- like a joke , you know .
one draws boundaries .
one part of it is rooted in istanbul , with strong turkish roots , but the other part travels the world , connecting to different cultures .
they connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
last one , this is &quot; who &apos;s going to buy you ribbons , &quot; another traditional folk tune .
apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early , but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades .
would a young and inexperienced apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like xerox ?
thank you so much . it was an honor to be here .
there &apos;s block 17 , house number one . &quot;
but actually , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the guardian newspaper .
what &apos;s fascinating and beautiful ...
it could be hundreds of kilometers deep , we think .
well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing .
it &apos;s one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on earth , is you can transport it , not only to the planets , but to the most distant stars and galaxies .
now , there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the big bang .
and that &apos;s a picture of me in front of it for scale .
he was clearly under assault all the time .
and when all of that data is held , they can do almost whatever they want with it .
the red dots have exploded .
because what we don &apos;t know can actually hurt us .
my journey began in 1971 when i witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the golden gate , and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay .
i got up in the morning and i didn &apos;t say a word .
we have a special program for you . &quot; they did .
i explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that i was john francis , i was walking around the world , i didn &apos;t talk and this was the last time this person &apos;s going to be here interpreting for me .
he said , &quot; i don &apos;t know how you do this , son -- i mean , you don &apos;t ride in cars , you don &apos;t talk .
well , my time at the coast guard was a really good time .
it took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , i had become a prisoner .
and i know that all of you have touched me while i &apos;ve been here .
i have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
i had learned that many people tried to cross the border to china in the nighttime to avoid being seen .
i didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
i did not come here by myself .
i will live my life happily and study hard until i see you , and i promise i will not cry again .
my goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
i started commuting to kobe , and i met the society of vietnamese people .
i was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
finally i met a very nice mayor in onagawa village in miyagi .
now i &apos;m a science reporter .
my favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that show once they were born .
the notion of fetal learning may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus -- like playing mozart through headphones placed on a pregnant belly .
but others wouldn &apos;t be discovered for many years .
at 8 : 46 a.m. on september 11th , 2001 , there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the world trade center in new york -- commuters spilling off trains , waitresses setting tables for the morning rush , brokers already working the phones on wall street .
i like to think of it as a kind of technological magic .
there are tales of creation and loss , death and resurrection , and obstacles that must be overcome .
we think in narrative structures .
we call ourselves the sleepy man banjo boys .
what &apos;s really , really sweet is every single person looking at these things has exactly the same mischievous thought , which is , &quot; i reckon i can heist these . &quot;
so what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very , very large budget .
i said , &quot; it &apos;s really , really easy . &quot;
but what i &apos;m saying is we could just make things a little bit better for ourselves if we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach .
thank you .
and they actually use the nintendo wii remote .
youtube has really changed the way , or changed the speed , in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world .
and for the first time , i began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people .
and i think the way that we go through that sometimes can , first of all , disembody a group of people , individuals out there in the world .
and in fact , through those interactions , for the first time , i was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away .
and my introduction to business was in these $ 100 little infuses of capital .
because as that happens , i think we can feel free to interact in a way that &apos;s more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
that &apos;s a much more meaningful combination , a more powerful combination .
so they can be a cash , or a cause , investor .
thank you .
but until recently , we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe .
furthermore , despite an extensive search by the seti project , we haven &apos;t heard any alien television quiz shows .
professor hawking , thank you for that answer .
i know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono when the number of possibilities is so huge , but i push you to consider the option of focusing on just one task , or maybe turning your digital senses totally off .
but drake &apos;s idea here became very popular because it was very appealing — and i &apos;ll get back to that — and on the basis of this experiment , which didn &apos;t succeed , we have been doing seti ever since , not continuously , but ever since .
you don &apos;t get one kitten . you get a bunch .
and the answer is that we don &apos;t know the answer .
i also think that exploration is important in terms of being able to address what i think is a critical lack in our society , and that is the lack of science literacy , the lack of the ability to even understand science .
yes , technologically , it &apos;s very sophisticated , but everybody gets the idea .
so that &apos;s my point , that you can have a big effect on these kids .
so we all are africans , and welcome home .
because it &apos;s only when you do that , that you can talk about -- -- it &apos;s only when you do that , &#91; that &#93; you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times , and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time .
so one of my assistants , who never went to school , said to me , &quot; listen , zeray .
and you see that in humans , because of the development of the pre-frontal cortex , it &apos;s called .
that &apos;s why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth -- faster than us , anyway .
imagine somebody coming from mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet earth , and you hide all the babies , the children , and he goes back and reports .
paleoanthropologist zeresenay alemseged looks for the roots of humanity in ethiopia &apos;s badlands . here he talks about finding the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child -- and how africa holds the clues to our humanity .
so what we have learned from social scientists and economists like elinor ostrom , who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale , is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all .
the sargasso sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat .
this is the initiative that &apos;s been coordinated by conservation international with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area .
but many of you have said , if you get these marine protected areas , or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place , how are you going to enforce it ?
kristina gjerde : making law on the high seas
there &apos;s no magic ; it &apos;s practice , practice , practice .
or failing that , do the eight things -- and trust me , these are the big eight things that lead to success .
ao : yeah .
adam ostrow : after your final status update
it tastes ...
so the symptoms of the complex are , no matter how complicated the problem , you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution .
brilliant work .
now i &apos;m not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here .
it falls to the floor .
the u.s. economy is still the world &apos;s greatest economy .
when schools stop doing that all the time , i will admit that , yes , it &apos;s obvious that trial and error is a good thing .
they &apos;re not statistically significant .
it isn &apos;t easy .
this is not a philosophical statement , this is just science based in physics , chemistry and biology .
that &apos;s not possible .
it certainly is .
in my view , it is well underway .
when the system was so clearly breaking down , mom and dad , what did you do , what were you thinking ? &quot;
we are smart , in fact , we really are quite amazing , but we do love a good crisis .
i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth , more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .
and somehow it will all make sense .
and the problem with this stuff is , now that the bill &apos;s come due , it turns out santa isn &apos;t quite as cute when it &apos;s summertime .
everything else is mandated .
that &apos;s the short term . that &apos;s the flame part .
first they don &apos;t grow .
it &apos;s almost like leaving congress .
that meant that you can take the stuff right here , and turn it into almost anything in your body .
and two or three olympics after that , they are going to be unbeatable .
and then you created earth about 4.5 billion years ago , and then you got life about four billion years ago , and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago , and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago .
but what they did , of course , since it was so complicated and expensive , they only used it on the zero-year-olds and the one-year-olds .
and he decided that maybe he should leave the country for a few days , and seek out some more intelligent , open-minded people in a place called oxford , and come and try and tell the story at that place .
and what you find is that the car seats and the lap-and-shoulder belts , when it comes to saving lives , fatalities look exactly identical .
now , eventually , one did . under the conditions of anonymity , they said they would be happy to do this test for us -- so anonymity , and 1,500 dollars per seat that we crashed .
but still , if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government , and said , &quot; i have invented a new car seat .
you &apos;ve got a regular seat for adults , and then you fold it down , and the kid sits on top , and it &apos;s integrated .
so in this data , it &apos;s statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lap-and-shoulder belts .
first of all , it was impossible , and it &apos;s not what it was .
so it &apos;s a very big number .
first of all , we have all these things in our hands .
now , with rfids and other things -- whatever technology it is , it doesn &apos;t really matter . the point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine , and so we have , basically , an internet of things .
now , the second thing that i want to talk about was this idea of restructuring , that what the web is doing is restructuring .
every person , every item will have a something that will be very specific , and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item .
so , the last thing i want to talk about is this idea that we &apos;re going to be codependent .
it will know us , and that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s me with the funny gloves .
and so i decided to write a book , a memoir , about this decade of my life .
god is going to fix all the problems in the world .
let me start some place . i &apos;m interested -- i kind of do the same thing , but i don &apos;t move my body .
and i &apos;ve had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear , and to understand the nature of the final result of that , representing the building itself .
and then , also , was working with broad strategies .
and you &apos;re looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body .
it forces air through a venturi force if there &apos;s no wind .
it demands some sort of notion of inquiry because it &apos;s a system that &apos;s developed not sculpturally .
and it makes for event space and then it breaks in places that allow you to peer into the interior , and those interiors , again , are promoting transparency for the workplace , which has been a continual interest of ours .
thom mayne : how architecture can connect us
we are the animals who eat cooked food .
if you can cook , nothing can happen to you , because whatever you find , you will try to transform it .
but of course , they are hard-wired but we use them still in a sophisticated way .
it penetrates the mucosa .
it &apos;s a very big signal ; it &apos;s sent to the brain says , &quot; go and eat . &quot;
this whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil .
and it was also the beginning of our discontent , because if you wanted to distill all of our experience since the paleolithic , it would come down to two words : how and why .
and if we slip from the realm of the sea into the realm of the spirit of the imagination , you enter the realm of tibetan buddhism .
they said , at one point , you know , we don &apos;t really believe you went to the moon , but you did .
but more importantly , it was linked in to the andean notions of sacred geography .
they say , &quot; upon this loom , i weave my life . &quot;
before we could begin our journey , we had to be cleansed at the portal of the earth .
now , i want to stress that none of these peoples that i &apos;ve been quickly talking about here are disappearing worlds .
anthropologist wade davis muses on the worldwide web of belief and ritual that makes us human . he shares breathtaking photos and stories of the elder brothers , a group of sierra nevada indians whose spiritual practice holds the world in balance .
the first is feedstocks .
and because they &apos;re made of natural materials , they are 100 percent compostable in you own backyard .
this matrix self-assembles , growing through and around the particles , making millions and millions of tiny fibers .
and i think that can be some really good news .
it enters a new state of matter called a superfluid .
go on the internet and search for &quot; dance your ph.d. &quot;
for example , our national endowment for the arts , with its $ 150 million budget , slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about one one-thousandth of a percent .
one of my senior colleagues told me , when i was a youngster in this profession , rather proudly , that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn &apos;t have the personality skills to become accountants .
and she was thinking about the work i did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern genetics .
that &apos;s what i want this side to think about .
you can &apos;t do that with head-tail-tail .
it &apos;s a very , very simple example , an easily stated question in probability , which every -- you &apos;re in good company -- everybody gets wrong .
there &apos;s a second big project , recently funded by the wellcome trust in this country , involving very large studies -- thousands of individuals , with each of eight different diseases , common diseases like type-1 and type-2 diabetes , and coronary heart disease , bipolar disease and so on -- to try and understand the genetics .
here &apos;s a little caricature of a million individuals .
and at the trial , her trial , a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths , innocent deaths , in a family like hers -- which was professional and non-smoking -- was one in 73 million .
the second problem is , what does the number of one in 73 million mean ?
many cases were reviewed .
usually -- one hopes -- innocently , but misrepresented evidence .
so what about circuit breakers ?
and i &apos;m pleased to announce that just three weeks ago we received our first international recognition , the 2009 ces innovation award .
it prevents weird things from the north .
but on the other hand , they want to keep the server in beijing so they can access the data any time they want .
and later this year , the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years .
it has its own innovation .
but also , the cat , the censorship , is not sleeping .
the story about the train crash , maybe the question is not about why 10 million criticisms in five days , but why the chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online .
but also , it gave the chinese a national public sphere for people to , it &apos;s like a training of their citizenship , preparing for future democracy .
really what we want to hear is music .
yeah .
girl : no , the other one was a book .
in fact , the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic-specificity .
but it certainly wasn &apos;t the way the music was intended .
again , we are very , very far away in just getting to where we want to get to .
he &apos;s deaf , and he learned to play the piano after he received the cochlear implant .
and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing .
i share the goals of the speakers you heard before .
today i want to tell you why .
he could have done something .
did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge , for violent rituals , for pure rage ?
failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability .
there &apos;s an ancient and universal concept that words have power , that spells exist , and that if we could only pronounce the right words , then -- whooosh -- you know , an avalanche would come and wipe out the hobbits , right ? so this is a very attractive idea because we &apos;re very lazy , like the sorcerer &apos;s apprentice , or the world &apos;s greatest computer programmer .
we understand it so well , in fact , that we think we can actually write programming languages for dna and have molecular compilers .
it &apos;s pretty simple . there are nine , sort of , rules that i discovered after 35 years of rock climbing .
you have to plan ahead to get to the top .
so balance is really critical , and keeping your weight on your feet , which is your strongest muscle .
kevin kelly talked about the acceleration of technology .
i &apos;m going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is .
but you see a very clear trend .
you could buy 10 million in 2002 .
and this is a very widespread phenomena .
the price performance , bandwidth , capacity of communications measured many different ways ; wired , wireless is growing exponentially .
if we come back to our exponential growth of computing , 1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain .
they &apos;ll be so small , they &apos;ll be embedded in our clothing , in our environment .
if you really look at the power of exponential growth , you &apos;ll see that these things are pretty soon at hand .
so what i want to talk about today is belief .
your name is lucy , okay ?
for example , what do you see here ?
while you &apos;re thinking about that , this was an experiment done by susan blackmore , a psychologist in england , who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an esp test : how much did they believe in the paranormal , supernatural , angels and so forth .
dopamine , i think , changes our signal-to-noise ratio .
it turns out what you &apos;re thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see .
here &apos;s some faces on the side of a rock .
so it &apos;s a type of that expanded to explain , i think , a lot of different things : souls , spirits , ghosts , gods , demons , angels , aliens , intelligent designers , government conspiracists and all manner of invisible agents with power and intention , are believed to haunt our world and control our lives .
well , that &apos;s a whole other lecture .
so this is a blind test .
and it was an amazing learning experience because , for me , human rights have been something in which i had , you know , a part-time interest , but , mainly , it was something that happened to other people over there .
jennifer : the man came and started undressing me .
you can say you don &apos;t trust newspapers .
and this is a clear indication that this is a valuable resource .
the sun is a very important cue in the sky for them .
and we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior .
there are 13 species in the genus , and they have a particular behavior that i think you will find interesting .
he displaces the beetle , and now we have to see what is going to take place .
it &apos;s about an 8-foot-long tube of metal , it &apos;s got a hundred or so holes on top , on that side is the speaker , and here is some lab tubing , and it &apos;s connected to this tank of propane .
this is all 40 minutes of the recording , and right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made , and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely to produce a cheer , and if you look really closely , we can tease out traffic patterns .
there &apos;s no closed captioning for the ted theme song , and we &apos;re missing it , but if you &apos;ve watched enough of these , you hear it in your mind &apos;s ear , and then applause starts .
in 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of mt . everest .
there was a bit of fun , a bit of joy .
there is a sort of misconception nowadays that it &apos;s all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure .
so i think it &apos;s safe to say i know a little bit about the process of pitching .
why should they put more money into your company , if you &apos;re not passionate about it ?
so what else do you require ?
it starts off , you walk in the door .
you &apos;ve also got to let me know that there are touchstones .
all right , so the best way to do this stuff is to look at our betters , look at people who have done this before .
best of all , images . just a simple image .
and i want to know the market -- the size of the market .
i want to know what the driver is .
now , in the process of doing this over here , how do you remember the sequences and doers ?
you &apos;re making a connection with your audience over here , and you always want to do a one-on-one connection .
now in the old days , that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically , maybe getting sidetracked , that was fun .
there are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums .
that &apos;s the idea behind voodoo dolls , and possibly also cave paintings .
years later , the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space , the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet .
we need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
so it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ?
it goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values rote learning , memorization and standardization , and devalues self-expression , self-exploration , questioning , creativity and play .
in social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
it &apos;s not the bears that learn how to fish better .
as a result , what happens ?
but i have news for you : our thinking is backwards .
they buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
it does , and it can , work in bulgaria .
let them be on the internet .
so i understand that this meeting was planned , and the slogan was from was to still .
i have so much to say . i have to think what i am going to say .
and finally , i had received a document that i had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully , that i had behaved morally , and this document was given to me by the guild of roof-coverers , rail-diggers , oven-setters , chimney sweeps and potters .
the first day i came to work in this shop there was on my wheel a surprise for me .
here i am now , if this is the end ? thank you .
these are some pieces of things i used in my sputnik feature film , which opens in new york in two weeks downtown .
that &apos;s my father &apos;s letter to me , telling me to marry the woman i first married when i was 20 .
av : that spawned a dating site .
we were in the process of giving birth to our first child .
the reason you &apos;re not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing .
i felt like i was a vessel of the future of humanity .
as i was working through that mourning process , i was amazed that i didn &apos;t want to see anybody .
basically , there &apos;s this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction , which is closely aligned , we all know , with broader happiness , that doesn &apos;t rise again until your first child goes to college .
but you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way , which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying .
so the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty , but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences , that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit .
so we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers .
before &quot; jurassic park , &quot; there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle , right ?
audio has come very late to this game -- i &apos;m not talking about digitizing , and bits , and re-mastering .
every time you listen to a recording today , every time you take out your ipod and whatever , every time you listen to it , it &apos;s the same thing -- it &apos;s frozen .
and fortunately , it &apos;s right in here .
i &apos;ve been a civil servant , and i &apos;ve been in charge of policy for this guy as well .
they often lead to the acceleration of much-needed reforms .
you can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world .
now , what he did didn &apos;t used to have a name , but i think it &apos;s rapidly becoming quite mainstream .
it &apos;s already immersed in social networks .
but this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we &apos;re just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago , and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for , or whether this is a moment to jump ahead , to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway .
now , how might that be ? let me give you an example .
it is the only germanic language that requires this .
now while these findings are suggestive , countries can be different in so many different ways that it &apos;s very , very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences .
it turns out there are six different ways to be married in europe .
keith chen : could your language affect your ability to save money ?
but i do know that i &apos;ve seen a lot of changes .
i don &apos;t think so .
this system equates intelligence with a knowledge of english , which is quite arbitrary .
so bingo , problem solved .
i am known best for human-powered flight , but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that i &apos;m working in now .
but that sure started me thinking about various things , and immediately , we began making a solar-powered plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world , we didn &apos;t want the small funding in the government to be decreased , which is what the government was trying to do with it .
and they form little groups , all fighting with each other , and when i leave , two hours later , most of them are saying about 2 billion people , and they don &apos;t have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion , nor do i , but i think they &apos;re right and this is a serious problem .
as the sky gets darker , and the outside air temperatures drop below minus 100 degrees fahrenheit , the most environmentally hostile segment of helios &apos;s journey has gone by without notice , except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors .
how old were you when you invented that ?
he said , &quot; a human being is a part of the whole , called by us , the &apos; universe , &apos; -- a part limited in time and space .
so he went on this retreat . and he meditated for three years and he did not see the future buddha maitreya .
and he becomes interested in this dog because it &apos;s so pathetic , and it &apos;s trying to attract his attention . and he sits down looking at the dog .
he jumps back and there , of course , is the future buddha maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights , golden , jeweled , a plasma body , an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees .
and it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one -- even animals too , but everyone is in human form .
and we don &apos;t hate anyone , therefore . so we equalize . that &apos;s very important .
and then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility .
and then you realize they don &apos;t even have compassion on themselves .
and that is very important -- the charter of compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion , what is called &quot; universal responsibility . &quot;
and let me just read it , the important details here : &quot; shorthand description , &#91; &apos; hardcore pornography &apos; &#93; ; and perhaps i could never succeed in intelligibly defining it .
and you then ask the question : why is the water hot ?
all right , what is complexity in this view of things , and what is emergence ?
and i want to introduce a word that i think is very useful , which is stacking .
so , since the transistor is so simple , you can put lots of them together .
you can build cathedrals out of stones , you just have to know what it does .
it turns colors . in this particular case , you &apos;re reading kidney function .
have you started to do that ?
30 years later , mountain bike sales and mountain bike equipment account for 65 percent of bike sales in america .
the payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest .
they do it on their own tapes , with their own recording equipment ; they distribute it themselves .
over here , you &apos;ve got the old , traditional corporate model : special people , special places ; patent it , push it down the pipeline to largely waiting , passive consumers .
or the op-ed page , where if they knew the editor -- had been to school with him , slept with his wife -- they could write an article for the op-ed page .
i was in shanghai , in an office block built on what was a rice paddy five years ago -- one of the 2,500 skyscrapers they &apos;ve built in shanghai in the last 10 years .
he &apos;s not open source , but it &apos;s very , very powerful .
in youngmenowme , the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult .
so the first thing i thought of is we have to thank him .
i look at this photo , and he seems really interested in what &apos;s going on with that button , but it doesn &apos;t seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street .
he died long after he left the pillow at my house , but we never got around to returning it . &quot;
these are very , very cute little things right .
so i was like , &quot; awesome . this is great . &quot;
hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine so i asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities , just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on , so i could just get their voices back .
and what came up was a number of pieces of data .
and it does have some consequences .
and the first murder of a mother by a son was my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather .
this is the large hadron collider .
why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began ? &quot;
and when the sun shines , you get copious quantities of these things , called neutrinos , pouring out .
this equation , though , allows you to calculate everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe .
well , what the higgs does is , it gives mass to the fundamental particles .
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
then light began to travel through the universe .
when i was a child , i always wanted to be a superhero .
outside of this room , more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day , whereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five .
a recent study at penn state university found that when you smile , you don &apos;t only appear to be more likable and courteous , but you actually appear to be more competent .
so it &apos;s time for change .
and this was not a misplaced feeling .
we created an online system of control and so speeded up all the processes .
i want to make more change as prime minister of my country , but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to .
outside haiti also , things were looking different .
83 percent of them took action -- evidence that it is indeed empowering .
in mongolia for instance , where 30 percent of the people are nomadic , sms information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns .
we now have the tools . we now have the possibilities .
you and i can experience things without a story .
what happens when that arrow goes awry ?
and therein lies its greatest convenience and horror .
by archiving everything , we think that we can store it , but time is not data .
abha dawesar : life in the &quot; digital now &quot;
she was five foot two , very feisty and very english .
at every single refugee camp , she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother mark , who was nine , and make him a boy soldier .
men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women , that &apos;s essentially what it is .
so , i was about nine , and my uncle had just come back from germany , and we had the catholic priest over , my mother was entertaining him with tea .
and he would always laugh , and say , &quot; come on , man , we &apos;ll make it out . &quot;
he pushes his tongue through a hole where his tooth would be , if he were whole .
this one happens to be a particularly important galaxy , because you are here .
because there have been at least 29 upgrades so far of humanoids .
and when we find these , we may find differences .
and it turns out that as we discover these things , we human beings really like to change how we look , how we act , what our bodies do .
and you can map the exact pathways when a mouse sees , feels , touches , remembers , loves .
but one question you might want to ask is , are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and of how we process data ?
juan enriquez : will our kids be a different species ?
of course , if the robot were tilted , inclined to the horizontal , then it would accelerate in this direction .
no matter how you throw it , the robot recovers and comes back to him .
and it does that avoiding obstacles .
so these ants don &apos;t have any central coordinator .
and despite the aerodynamic interactions of these propeller blades , they &apos;re able to maintain stable flight .
it builds the map .
this man is wearing what we call a bee beard .
you can see the orientation . the stem is down .
why are bees doing better in the city ?
so my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier .
some other images here in telling a part of the story that really made urban beekeeping terrific is in new york city , beekeeping was illegal until 2010 .
bees have been rapidly and mysteriously disappearing from rural areas , with grave implications for agriculture . but bees seem to flourish in urban environments -- and cities need their help , too . noah wilson-rich suggests that urban beekeeping might play a role in revitalizing both a city and a species . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
a way that is perhaps more real , more honest .
that is the reality of our modern life .
so as food became more plentiful , bread became cheaper .
in fact not many of you know that our bread , of course , was not a european invention .
one of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly -- doubling by about 2030 .
that &apos;s where we should move .
we cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture .
and i think there is nobody else who has expressed better , to me , the idea that food , in the end , in our own tradition , is something holy .
but in the developing world , things are quite different .
because those bicycle parts are so ubiquitously available , they &apos;re super-cheap .
but the day after he got an lfc , he hopped in it , rode that kilometer , opened up his shop and soon after landed a contract to make school uniforms and started making money , started providing for his family again .
the king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons .
now we &apos;ve caught more than 100 king cobras over the last three years , and relocated them in nearby forests .
and now the king cobra is a new one .
and pretty soon we were seeing sights like this .
it flows down through delhi , mathura , agra , and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine .
and it &apos;s a bleak future for them .
i look at it as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being .
i studied yoga for many years with a teacher named swami satchidananda and people would say , &quot; what are you , a hindu ? &quot; he &apos;d say , &quot; no , i &apos;m an undo . &quot;
i got this as a christmas card a few years ago from two of the patients in one of our programs .
and telling people they &apos;re going to die is too scary to think about , or , they &apos;re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary , and so they don &apos;t want to think about it , so they don &apos;t .
these are not election returns ; these are the percentage of people who are overweight .
so , and you get all the disease-protective substances .
so when you go on these kinds of diet , they begin to smell bad .
now , on the other hand , anything that promotes intimacy is healing .
i &apos;m here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years .
ed ulbrich : that was a clip from &quot; the curious case of benjamin button . &quot;
we even ruled out the idea of using makeup .
you know , this is some tough stuff .
i &apos;m sure many of you have seen motion capture .
he believed that there were 70 basic poses or shapes of the human face , and that those basic poses or shapes of the face can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing .
we need to put another 40 years on him at this point .
so these are the gentleman who played benjamin .
we had to create a lighting system .
so , as things went through this process , fincher would always say , &quot; it sandblasts the edges off of the performance . &quot;
sadly , the family of qalandars depended on this bear .
this is sadua who came and surrendered his bear .
and the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again .
keith bellows : yeah , yeah .
and i &apos;ve developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point , and i &apos;ve realized that this is a mean son of a bitch .
when they &apos;re in rut -- they &apos;re similar to seals in the way , like , a seal has to open its nose to breathe .
now , they will also defecate in certain areas .
now , what you also didn &apos;t see was that -- and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and , by the way , the camel &apos;s name is suki .
short fur that keeps my skin cool .
my dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory .
and the poem , if it &apos;s written with the ear , already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed .
one of my students came up after class , an introductory class , and she said , &quot; you know , poetry is harder than writing , &quot; which i found both erroneous and profound .
it has floated away down a dark mythological river whose name begins with an l as far as you can recall , well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those who have forgotten even how to swim and how to ride a bicycle .
so the little poem is called &quot; the dead . &quot;
a few centuries later , when he was your age , franz schubert was doing the dishes for his family , but that did not keep him from composing two symphonies , four operas and two complete masses as a youngster .
and about a second after i took the picture , they came together in the fork of the tree and they kissed and embraced each other .
and human morality is more than this , but if you would remove these two pillars , there would be not much remaining i think .
now with elephants , it &apos;s very dangerous to work with elephants .
this was the cooperation , reciprocity part .
so that &apos;s what you see on the upper-left , an animated head that yawns .
and they have to pick one of the two colors .
and i &apos;m going to show you the first experiment that we did .
she gives a rock to us now , gets , again , cucumber .
but what he &apos;s doing is so easy to follow .
okay , but we might have missed the real lesson here .
but i decided to learn about the bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it .
i had to do that properly .
i went to the dark side , and i just indulged myself .
is that -- and it &apos;s actually been a theme of tedmed -- that joy is so important to your health , that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there &apos;s some sense of pleasure and joy in them .
specifically , we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react when they &apos;re treated unfairly .
here &apos;s one example : neuro drinks , a line of products , including nuero bliss here , which according to its label helps reduce stress , enhances mood , provides focused concentration , and promotes a positive outlook .
it quickly became the most emailed article on the site .
so we &apos;ve seen neuro-flapdoodle all over the headlines .
brains are ubiquitous in modern marketing : headlines proclaim cheese sandwiches help with decision-making , while a &quot; neuro &quot; drink claims to reduce stress . there &apos;s just one problem , says neuroscientist molly crockett : the benefits of these &quot; neuro-enhancements &quot; are not proven scientifically . in this to-the-point talk , crockett explains the limits of interpreting neuroscientific data , and why we should all be aware of them .
we don &apos;t know .
these people believe that the indus script represents an ancient form of the dravidian language family , which is the language family spoken in much of south india today .
i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds .
there &apos;s also practical use for this particular procedure .
if you don &apos;t know dutch and you only know english and i give you some words in dutch , you &apos;ll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns .
you have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense .
what would they tell us ?
and just like the signals that we send and receive here on earth , we can convert these transmissions into sound using simple analog techniques .
but going from slinging some wire across rooftops in boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the atlantic ocean seabed is no easy matter .
but the noise didn &apos;t disappear .
he made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected .
who &apos;s not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings -- if you &apos;re different from all the other beings ?
the good time is over when you think , how good is it ?
she scared us with the lava man is coming , then the tsunami is coming , but then finally there were flowers and trees , and it was very beautiful .
this is birhan , who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the 1980s , 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued , and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world .
they won public opinion over a long period of time .
i was sitting next to nelson mandela -- i was very privileged to do so -- when amy winehouse came onto the stage .
so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility , not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years .
tortured to death .
so please send me your ideas about how to design a foot .
it &apos;s still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour .
it uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there -- truly extraordinary .
maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he &apos;d be brave enough to touch the cockroach .
watch the leg come around , and you &apos;ll see it grab on right there .
mark cutkosky at stanford university , one of my collaborators , is an extraordinary engineer who developed this technique called shape deposition manufacturing , where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot .
these are its feet .
i think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity-based research -- we just wondered how they climbed up something -- can lead to things that you could never imagine .
so this is not using any suction , any glue , and it will ultimately , when it &apos;s attached to the robot -- it &apos;s as biologically inspired as the animal -- hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface .
and what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world and also to stay in touch with one another .
by contrast , the signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch , each individual here has a radically different call .
but it turns out that when just a single boat is approaching a group of dolphins at a couple hundred meters away , the dolphins will start whistling , they &apos;ll change what they &apos;re doing , they &apos;ll have a more cohesive group , wait for the boat to go by , and then they &apos;ll get back to normal business .
in the early &apos; 70s , roger payne and an ocean acoustician published a theoretical paper pointing out that it was possible that sound could transmit over these large areas , but very few biologists believed it .
but in &apos; 96 they heard a few weird songs , and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales .
there &apos;s a potential problem that maybe this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales from being able to hear each other .
here &apos;s a typical south atlantic contact call from the &apos; 70s .
these black lines mark shipping lanes in and out of the bay of fundy .
thank you very much .
second : you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides .
it &apos;ll be a free download -- thank you , craig mundie -- and it &apos;ll be available at the website worldwidetelescope.org , which is something new .
the old shyness was a fear of rejection .
so the effect , very quickly , is it &apos;s a new kind of arousal .
there &apos;s no manual . this is exactly what you expect , especially if you haven &apos;t interacted with a computer before .
it &apos;s kind of a puppeteering thing , where i can use as many fingers as i have to draw and make -- now , there &apos;s a lot of actual math going on under here for this to control this mesh and do the right thing .
we have a big problem .
the problem is that we play the role of victims .
this vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses , scared to death -- even more afraid than when we were out on the streets .
seven days later , eric was set free and was able to return home .
our mother , mexico , is being violated before our very eyes .
one of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer , but he was lefty .
thanks . so , visual music : rhythm and complexity .
ok ? and whoever laughed there -- you understood it completely , right ?
white .
so what i want you to do is -- fingers .
there &apos;s a piece that i recently developed which was all about that , a moment . and what i do as a creative artist is i develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects .
are we ready to do that ? yes ?
this is a little thing that i made because i really like the idea of curves and balls together .
and then changing levels .
and if you were here last year , i probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new eyemodule 2 , which was a camera that plugged into the handspring .
so , there &apos;re lots of things . everything has rf tags : there &apos;s rf tags on the user , on the cards , there &apos;s the staff devices that are all around the store .
and also , it &apos;s not shown in the video , but these are very beautiful .
so this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time .
the fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself underwater . ) and the last thing i &apos;ll talk about is approtec , which is a project that i &apos;m very excited about .
there is more of it than you think , actually .
&quot; not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness , she turns it to her advantage .
in the question of consciousness and artificial intelligence , artificial intelligence has really , like the study of consciousness , gotten nowhere . we have no idea how consciousness works .
you can &apos;t see the future , obviously .
but well done , him .
thomas edison once said , &quot; we don &apos;t know one percent of one millionth about anything . &quot;
so many books actually have been written over the years .
of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole ...
alternatively , i could say , &quot; yesterday , i thrived . &quot;
but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 .
el there are more sobering notes among the n-grams .
but then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda .
there &apos;s various types of frustration .
so in a cocktail party like this , if i say , &quot; david , sara , pay attention , &quot; some of you just sat up .
well there are a lot of reasons for this .
just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again .
this is playing with those filters .
so i didn &apos;t always make my living from music .
so i would need a piano to practice on , and an hour later i would be at a fan &apos;s house . this is in london .
she &apos;s an artist . he &apos;s a financial blogger for reuters , and they &apos;re pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath , and i have had thousands of nights like that and like that .
and this is the moment i decide i &apos;m just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible , so it &apos;s like metallica over here , napster , bad ; amanda palmer over here , and i &apos;m going to encourage torrenting , downloading , sharing , but i &apos;m going to ask for help , because i saw it work on the street .
now let me tell you , if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers , i recommend this , especially if those strangers are drunk german people .
the occupy movement found a voice , and i still have to speak english constantly .
actually , that photo was pasted in a police station , and what you see on the ground are id cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police .
education is so essential .
jr : one year of turning the world inside out
today is , i think , the 50th anniversary of the discovery of dna .
well , it took longer than four years . it &apos;s been about 16 years .
we have this mountain of data , which is anatomy , physiology and behavior .
it &apos;s not as complex as it looks . that &apos;s not the issue .
finally , another thing is the answer was there all along , but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing , and that &apos;s the thing .
real intelligence is built on something else .
no , really , that &apos;s what it is . it &apos;s about the size of a table napkin .
so let me give you a few examples of predictions .
it &apos;s not like you just look over there and say , what am i seeing now ?
first of all , it &apos;s going to be a theory about memory .
you &apos;re going to more see things like , you know , intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is and what driving is and have learned that certain types of cars with the blinkers on for half a minute probably aren &apos;t going to turn , things like that .
this is called human security .
it is using our money for all of those things .
she said , &quot; you know , we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country .
i &apos;ll tell you the quick story .
and we can &apos;t wait for the other guy . we have to do it ourselves .
and yet , in the world , there are so many people who still heat the water on fire , and they cook their food on fire .
and some of them proudly raise their hand and say , &quot; i don &apos;t use a car . &quot;
and &#91; with &#93; that you will get two extra , but that won &apos;t change the energy use very much .
but i can assure you that this woman in the favela in rio , she wants a washing machine .
i would like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving adam and eve , and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past 10 years .
we started from social media data , we combined it statistically with data from u.s. government social security , and we ended up predicting social security numbers , which in the united states are extremely sensitive information .
we created facebook profiles , manipulating traits , then we started sending out résumés to companies in the u.s. , and we detected , we monitored , whether they were searching for our candidates , and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media . and they were .
it makes sense , right ?
they &apos;re happy . they are satisfied .
they have what i called &quot; logorrhea dementia , &quot; which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane .
and if you &apos;re not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student , you &apos;re not talking about that reality .
and they go to whole foods to get their baby formula , and whole foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they &apos;re on loan from amnesty international .
and this leads to oddities .
we emerge out of relationships , and we are deeply interpenetrated , one with another .
scientists at the university of minnesota did a study in which they could predict with 77 percent accuracy , at age 18 months , who was going to graduate from high school , based on who had good attachment with mom .
one of my colleagues at the times did a great story about soldiers in iraq who could look down a street and detect somehow whether there was an ied , a landmine , in the street .
and hofstadter wrote a book called &quot; i am a strange loop . &quot;
and when we took her to the hospital she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body .
most of them come from very optionless families , not just poor .
and it &apos;s abnormal to live in a shelter .
these girls are also working in big construction companies like ram-ki construction , as masons , full-time masons .
i &apos;m here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking .
now , have any of y &apos;all ever looked up this word ?
so if i had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work , i would much rather be a fisherman .
they don &apos;t change the end result .
she thought , &quot; well , my mom always did this . &quot;
the book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in . and it &apos;s not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in .
but if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic , but maybe to count the cars that go by , then more eyeballs are better .
if that was the map of all the words in american english , we don &apos;t know very much .
because i &apos;m going to the internet , which is where everybody goes .
doesn &apos;t everyone want more meaning in their lives ?
fifteen years earlier , i was a science journalist who people just laughed at when i said , &quot; i really would like to start my own computer magazine . &quot;
and the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much , and it was incredibly exciting .
every mental organ addressed . it really is .
what sapling &apos;s ownership means is that all of the proceeds of ted will go towards the causes that sapling stands for .
manufacturers haven &apos;t built this carrier phase technique into their cheap gps chips because they &apos;re not sure what the general public would do with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint the wrinkles in the palm of your hand .
&quot; i already have , &quot; she told me .
they -- in fact , they don &apos;t update or upkeep lighthouses anymore , and loran , the only backup to gps , was discontinued last year .
we built it at my home , which means that i got a little extra help from my three-year-old son ramon .
you &apos;ll never lose track of your things again .
this device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
and we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .
but it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up .
okay , i &apos;m reading that at about 75 to 25 in favor at the start .
now , from an environmental standpoint , the main thing you want to look at is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal , the two major sources of electricity .
in terms of weapons , the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy .
and it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation .
and so , on the right , you see gasoline emissions , the death rates of 2020 .
now if we go to the area , lots is worse than nuclear or wind .
so while they &apos;re having their comebacks on each other -- and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran -- i need two people from either side .
we need someone for .
for .
so each of you has really just a couple sentences -- 30 seconds each to sum up .
so if you were in palm springs ...
and then we discovered these things -- gold and oil and fishing and timber -- and it became , you know , a trillion-dollar economy , and now we take our honeymoons there . the same thing will happen in space .
this is gene cernan , a good friend of mine , saying , &quot; if i can go to the moon &quot; -- this is the last human on the moon so far -- &quot; nothing , nothing is impossible . &quot; but of course , we &apos;ve thought about the government always as the person taking us there .
it &apos;s about 5.7 gigajoules of energy .
pilot : release our fire .
quick moment for the designers in the audience .
and the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term .
if we could free ourselves from our education ?
we can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions .
how ? and at what scale ?
but enough of the theory .
i &apos;ve shown one simple process that was inspired by nature ; there &apos;s countless other ones .
well , wouldn &apos;t it be nice if it was that easy ?
but it &apos;s taken a long time to get there .
and the kids that you see here all volunteered to be part of this , 28 of them , and you can see as soon as the picture comes up that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people all afflicted by this disease , all looking quite similar to each other .
that could be a phenomenal , valuable activity .
are those cells happy or not ?
it &apos;s a very young nation led by young people .
and this is what the leaders of this region we &apos;re trying to be part of this global village , but at the same time we &apos;re revising ourselves through our cultural institutions and cultural development .
ask me .
some of you might have heard of the algerian artist baya mahieddine , but i doubt a lot of people know that this artist worked in picasso &apos;s studio in paris in the 1930s .
sm : going back to straddling between east and west , last month we had our second doha tribeca film festival here in doha .
what i wanted to do is to show the world that the little things can be the biggest things .
at that age , obviously , i couldn &apos;t express it that way , but i told her i didn &apos;t feel right .
and from there i was watching this little world .
so i got the teddy bear and i said , &quot; do you mind if i pull out one of your fibers ? &quot;
and then that was it .
i think he was just warning him actually .
but i would never do it to a living fly .
in america they say a period stop .
so i says , &quot; ok then , if you say it &apos;s a machine ... &quot;
as you can see , he &apos;s looking at the moment . he &apos;s got a little grimace on his face .
and in a saying of the koran , which to muslims is god speaking to humanity , god says to his prophet muhammad -- whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets , beginning with adam , including noah , including moses , including abraham , including jesus christ , and ending with muhammad -- that , &quot; we have not sent you , o muhammad , except as a &apos; rahmah , &apos; except as a source of compassion to humanity . &quot;
and those of you who are employers know exactly what i mean .
through our subconscious , in your dreams -- the koran calls our state of sleep &quot; the lesser death , &quot; &quot; the temporary death &quot; -- in our state of sleep we have dreams , we have visions , we travel even outside of our bodies , for many of us , and we see wonderful things .
we have reached a stage in human history that we have no option : we must , we must lower our egos , control our egos -- whether it is individual ego , personal ego , family ego , national ego -- and let all be for the glorification of the one .
until , in may 2008 , a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones .
they may not have their dad .
and the first one was no family , only friends .
and i got to the end -- he was crying and i was crying -- and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
actually i had cisplatin , doxorubicin and very high-dose methotrexate .
they were actually putting blood inside my body .
and that particularly happened -- there was one in my life -- is this council of dads that linda said , what we were talking about , it &apos;s like what the moms talk about at school drop-off .
i was on crutches , my wife was next to me , my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead .
my lost year was my jubilee year .
may you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace , or find a way to get over , around , or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams .
dp : &quot; molly malone . &quot;
i think that one of the first things that happened when you were very little , derek , was that by the time you were two , your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults .
dp : &quot; flight of the bumblebee &quot; on that note .
you &apos;re a fantastic , creative musician , and i think that was nowhere clearer to see , really , than when we went to slovenia , and someone -- in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in , and this person , very , very nervously came onto the stage .
but i &apos;m also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of design within reach catalogs , so i pretty much know everything there is .
i have no idea . i don &apos;t know what that thing is .
good morning everyone . first of all , it &apos;s been fantastic being here over these past few days .
i &apos;ve been studying chimpanzees in tanzania since 1960 .
it was , fortunately , one adult male whom i &apos;d named david greybeard -- and by the way , science at that time was telling me that i shouldn &apos;t name the chimps ; they should all have numbers ; that was more scientific .
we find that they show emotions , similar to -- maybe sometimes the same -- as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness , sadness , fear , despair .
and the grim picture in africa -- i love africa , and what do we see in africa ?
how can we do it ?
and the third kind of project : something for the local environment .
violence leads to violence , at least in my view .
we can see a whole area desolated , and it can be brought back to bloom again , with time or a little help .
we &apos;ll just take one example here : a virus is a natural system , right ?
we use this idea called self-assembly .
some things are missing .
we &apos;re going to make two different kinds .
you turn up the heat , you start making or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar , forming a brownish caramel , right ?
without the sun , there &apos;s likely to be no life on this planet .
the environment is implicated , radically implicated , right .
very lucky .
and i want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way .
somehow buying a local lettuce , changing a light bulb , driving the speed limit , changing your tires regularly , doesn &apos;t seem sufficient in the face of climate crisis .
and then i swap it out with the students and actually re-release that carbon black .
these are just your average urban pigeon .
you can subscribe to updates from him . you can talk to him .
what &apos;s crazy is what we do today .
if we can succeed here , it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon .
and we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities , like softness , breathability , durability , elasticity and even things like pattern .
people love their automobiles .
and we wanted to take advantage of moore &apos;s law with electronic controls and software , and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected .
now that &apos;s a lot of money .
larry , larry , wait , wait , wait , wait , larry , wait , wait one sec .
so , see , kids like us , we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school , and sometimes we &apos;re just not ready to focus .
i was accepted to pepperdine university , and i came back to the same school that i attended to be a special ed assistant .
our community deserved a new way of doing things .
thank you .
i put photography as my life .
to build development , brazilian development , we destroyed a lot of our forest .
we must protect the forest in this sense .
the trees are the hair of our planet .
cities , past and future .
for those of you who are from new york , this is 125th street under the west side highway .
this is richmond hill , and minetta water , which used to run its way through greenwich village .
and the old fields , the successional fields that go .
moreover , we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist , but you can look up what an aspen needs .
and then we took this data .
and even though i &apos;ve only had a brief time to speak , i hope you appreciate that mannahatta was a very special place .
you know , about a million years ago , a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees , got a little clever , harnessed fire , invented the printing press , made , you know , luggage with wheels on it .
and those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did , no matter where they live .
so , first of all , what are we looking for ? bright green city .
when you know where things are , it becomes easier to share them .
they live in the emerging megacities of the developing world .
and those things lead to things like this .
and sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement . right ?
you get grassroots solutions , things that work for people who have no capital or limited access .
new models for pedagogy for the displaced .
the store owned one of those machines that can print on plates of sugar .
now to understand how congress came to write a bill that won &apos;t accomplish its stated goals , but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects , you have to understand a little bit about the back story .
but this taping business , fine , let it go .
some of the stuff we share is stuff we &apos;ve made .
you don &apos;t have millions and millions of dollars , but you can call your representatives , and you can remind them that you vote , and you can ask not to be treated like a thief , and you can suggest that you would prefer that the internet not be broken .
because that &apos;s the real message of pipa and sopa .
and i wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot;
so the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice .
you come for the money , you don &apos;t come to barefoot college .
no water , rocky soil . &quot;
you &apos;ll never find indian women so precise .
she got the world &apos;s children &apos;s prize five years ago , and she went to sweden .
all across the globe , you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate .
and they haven &apos;t collapsed .
went to this village .
they &apos;re all over the world .
this first project is called the allobrain .
this is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms .
inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we &apos;ve created at santa barbara .
so , just give it a moment of thought .
unlike sir thomas , you seem not to know it .
glorious ! this guy is not saying , &quot; well , you know , there were some nice guys . they had a gym . &quot;
why do we have that belief ?
now what &apos;s the right response to that ? &quot; yeah , right ! &quot;
here &apos;s what normal controls do : they synthesize happiness .
&quot; ah ! now that you mention it , it does seem a little silkier ! &quot;
your picture will be winging its way over the atlantic .
it &apos;s nice poetry , but that can &apos;t exactly be right .
two stage rockets , rockets with video cameras on them , on-board computers logging their flights , rocket gliders that fly back to earth .
voices : it &apos;s going ballistic . oh shit .
&quot; you &apos;re talking to me already . what &apos;s the matter ? &quot;
i love that , but we don &apos;t have the time .
but this story only happened a few years ago .
rockports -- they &apos;re for this .
she &apos;s engineered an umbrella so she can -- bam ! -- slam the door .
&quot; mommy , i know you have been stopped . &quot;
now , you have all been at a mall during the holidays , yes ?
olivia ? huh ? huh ?
&quot; i &apos;m coming . &quot; italian hand signals follow .
i look in bewildered awe : she &apos;s standing , those rockports slightly apart , but grounded .
she &apos;s got front seat in a greek tragedy .
i said , &quot; no , i follow little old women around parking lots to see if they &apos;ll stop . yes , it &apos;s my mother ! &quot;
and i &apos;m really worried , because when people talk about cars -- which i know something about -- the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking , &quot; let &apos;s use fuel-efficient cars . &quot;
people adore the company . and it &apos;s better , you know ? they like it .
one last piece about this , of course , is that it &apos;s enabled by wireless technologies .
so , i want to move now to the second part of my story , which is : when are we going to start doing this congestion pricing ? road pricing is coming .
again , all mesh-enabled . monthly communication cost : zero .
so , i &apos;d like us to launch the wireless internet interstate wireless mesh system , and require that this network be accessible to everyone , with open standards .
my mom left nairobi , kenya .
it &apos;s still heavy now , and it was heavy before that , but when you flipped open a newspaper , when you turned on the tv , it was about ice caps melting , wars going on around the world , earthquakes , hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse , and then eventually did collapse , and so many of us losing our homes , or our jobs , or our retirements , or our livelihoods .
i was like , that sounds totally fake .
having a great attitude is about choosing option number two , and choosing , no matter how difficult it is , no matter what pain hits you , choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future .
they were tough football players doing what they love , which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field .
so i wanted to ask them to , if they don &apos;t mind , stand up .
and when we did , my dad would say , &quot; can you believe someone climbed a tree over there , picked this thing off it , put it in a truck , drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the atlantic ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house , so they could sell it to us for 25 cents ? &quot;
thank you .
unlike the grand canyon or the washington monument , people come here to see what &apos;s no longer there .
were you conscious of suddenly -- as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants -- suddenly fulfilling needs ?
dr : yeah , surprising .
but then you &apos;ve got to figure out a way -- we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing .
there was no sense of the fact that this is next to saint paul -- that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified , and a place to reflect and remember .
it &apos;s all incredibly humble material .
but it had some really terrible ideas .
as you say , it &apos;s not a memorial .
zzzzzzip for safety .
seventy-two .
isn &apos;t it weird that my 48-year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car , from the driveway ? &quot;
just two weeks ago , a bill introduced by senator kefalas that would have required athletes , kids under 18 , to wear a helmet when they &apos;re riding their bike died in committee .
but i have a problem with that belief , because i know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems .
and i &apos;m not comfortable with that .
so here is my point : under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room .
people in our countries here in europe , in north america , were living with hiv , healthy lives .
second , the practice of patent-holding companies have changed .
that is something that the medicines patent pool cannot do .
together with the architects of albert speer &amp; amp ; partner , our engineers from transsolar have been supporting , have been developing open-air stadia based on 100 percent solar power , on 100 percent solar cooling .
which is the driving parameter which gives me a perceived temperature ? and these parameters , these climatic parameters are related to the human metabolism .
our idea for the bid was 100 percent solar cooling , based on the idea that we use the roof of the stadia , we cover the roofs of the stadia with pv systems .
he has this little 10-square-meter store , where so much is being done .
so we said , &quot; what can we do to empower this teacher to do more ? &quot; how to access the digital world ?
so if there was something that she could do , that would be amazing .
ladies and gentlemen , the history of music and television on the internet in three minutes .
i became obsessed with how it might be that we &apos;re embedded in these social networks , and how they affect our lives .
it says that , if your friends are obese , your risk of obesity is 45 percent higher .
was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person ?
and not only do we show them , but others can read them .
and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch .
that &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
so think about these two common objects .
we &apos;re all embedded in vast social networks of friends , family , co-workers and more . nicholas christakis tracks how a wide variety of traits -- from happiness to obesity -- can spread from person to person , showing how your location in the network might impact your life in ways you don &apos;t even know .
that &apos;s right , older people are happy .
now you see this slight downturn at very advanced ages .
well in our research , we &apos;ve found that these changes are grounded fundamentally in the uniquely human ability to monitor time -- not just clock time and calendar time , but lifetime .
laura carstensen : older people are happier
dancers have created a whole global laboratory online for dance , where kids in japan are taking moves from a youtube video created in detroit , building on it within days and releasing a new video , while teenagers in california are taking the japanese video and remixing it with a philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself .
so , it was always like , they called me kid david , because i was the kid .
so take a look around this auditorium today .
we promise that the powder river country will henceforth be closed to all whites .
that clause was obviously ignored .
they were tired of treaties .
school dropout rate is up to 70 percent .
the suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix .
now , there was a big effort to solve this problem , and there was actually a big solution .
well , it turns out -- and this is where things get really disconcerting -- it &apos;s not unique to diarrhea .
the problem is this little three-pound machine that &apos;s behind your eyes and between your ears .
well , one possibility -- i think that &apos;s how most people respond to this -- is to say , &quot; that &apos;s just stupid . &quot;
this is easy , $ 1.10 .
these models , like the leaky bucket , work well in most situations .
and they say , &quot; you know what ? do i need turbo ? do i need this heavyweight car ? &quot;
so , let me now talk about the last mile problem .
this isn &apos;t about the biology of people ; this is now about the brains , the psychology of people , and innovation needs to continue all the way through the last mile .
we &apos;re on the verge of a whole new social science .
alright sendhil , thanks so much for coming to ted . thank you .
so if i take this salt dough , again , it &apos;s like the play-dough you probably made as kids , and i plug it in -- it &apos;s a two-lead battery pack , simple battery pack , you can buy them at radio shack and pretty much anywhere else -- we can actually then light things up .
we have a website , it &apos;s all there . these are the home recipes .
&quot; worrying solves nothing . &quot;
three days later it faded , and a week later , no more complaining anywhere .
now , the shortcut .
now i will interact . so a different person all the time , so not the same person can answer .
so , please mix them .
so -- because if you look , now , i can still see it .
it &apos;s called &quot; bicycle . &quot; and this deck is very flexible , but not so many people know , if you check , if you press at the right spots , you see how thin and flexible this deck is , right ?
i think jack of spades is number 12 from the top .
lg : pardon ?
here , i will do the most difficult thing .
right , sorry , my -- i should have mentioned that , yeah .
so every time i lift the heap , i peek , right .
lg : pardon ?
yes , yes , ok .
but i like her , yeah . i said , be a little tough .
yeah , good .
seven .
good . oh .
now , what happened was not maybe what you thought , which is , he suddenly became passionate , engaged , involved , got a new teacher , he hit puberty , or whatever it is .
and you have cds in your car , and you go to the symphony .
you have a fantastic ear . everybody has a fantastic ear .
and the job of the c is to make the b sad . and it does , doesn &apos;t it ?
right . so , he gets to e , but it &apos;s the wrong chord .
a beloved grandmother , a lover -- somebody in your life who you love with all your heart , but that person is no longer with you .
how would you talk ? how would you be ?
for me , it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s not about wealth and fame and power .
thank you .
now i want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem , done by a scientist named sam glucksberg , who is now at princeton university in the u.s .
these contingent motivators -- if you do this , then you get that -- work in some circumstances .
you want to be looking around .
let me give you an example of what i mean .
training ground for great economic thinkers like george soros , and friedrich hayek , and mick jagger .
let me give you some examples of some kind of radical notions of self-direction .
they show up when they want .
this is the thrilla &apos; in manila .
so it allows it to roll .
this one is about the moon and then the distance to the earth , in proportion also .
so as you turn around you &apos;re seeing different colors .
so if we could roll the next film here .
it could be interacted with large crowds in different ways .
i want to talk about how the things we &apos;ve been taught to think about giving and about charity and about the nonprofit sector are actually undermining the causes we love and our profound yearning to change the world .
you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it .
that &apos;s an important fact , because it tells us that in 40 years , the nonprofit sector has not been able to wrestle any market share away from the for-profit sector .
the puritans came here for religious reasons , or so they said , but they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money .
within nine years , we had multiplied that 1,982 times into 108 million dollars after all expenses for aids services .
the rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals and that 60 billion dollars is not nearly enough to tackle these problems .
and in front of all that noise , you do a very small gesture .
so that &apos;s a sort of a tradition .
let &apos;s see somebody else , a great conductor .
it &apos;s mozart as i , riccardo muti , understand it . &quot;
so , no , he doesn &apos;t want that . that &apos;s a different kind of control .
why are the eyes closed ?
that &apos;s what he does .
i have a short notice to give you . &quot;
so control is no longer a zero-sum game .
and for the last video , i think this is simply the best title .
but as we straddle the top of this energy mountain , at this stage , we move from a time where our economic success , our sense of individual prowess and well-being is directly linked to how much of this we consume , to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability .
and one of the ways i like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil , before we had fossil fuels , and people relied on their own muscle , animal muscle energy , or a little bit of wind , little bit of water energy .
we can be astonishingly inventive and creative .
when they encounter shock from the outside that they don &apos;t just unravel and fall to pieces .
we need national responses . we need local government responses .
in scotland , the scottish government &apos;s climate change fund has funded transition scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this .
many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are .
how could you have a problem like this ?
they make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out .
there &apos;s ways , if it &apos;s temporary , to minimize the impact , but it &apos;s a problem .
we need better tools .
it allows us to do the art , the biotechnology , the software and all those magic things .
and after two more years of studying music , i decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the mcat and applying to medical school like a good indian son to become the next dr. gupta .
keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
so during the course of the day , five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment .
okay , next , clubbing .
here &apos;s three quick ideas i came up with .
the theme of my talk today is , &quot; be an artist , right now . &quot;
they &apos;re shocked .
take a look at this sentence : &quot; one morning , as gregor samsa was waking up from anxious dreams , he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug . &quot;
when i ask my students to write about their happiest moment , many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid .
you &apos;re told to do it and there &apos;s competition . how can it be fun ?
most of the works have no title , untitled .
that &apos;s how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side .
they can write the play , for example , and the writers may work on stage art .
so i can say this : it &apos;s not the hundreds of reasons why one can &apos;t be an artist , but rather , the one reason one must be that makes us artists .
he proudly said he played king lear .
let &apos;s start with how i got to this point .
heatwaves and droughts on one hand , directly from the warming , but also , because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy , rainfall will become in more extreme events .
so the key quantity is earth &apos;s energy imbalance .
as you see , there &apos;s a high correlation between temperature , co2 and sea level .
i think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels , perhaps even five meters , which is 18 feet , this century or shortly thereafter .
it is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future .
thank you .
he worked with john wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see in the westerns . yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated .
being run over is never easy .
i sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are .
this is a shot of &quot; terminator , &quot; the movie .
they first dropped some dummies .
certainly at 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly .
this is what the view is going to be like at 90,000 feet for me .
i would like to bring costa on , if he &apos;s here , to show you the only one of its kind in the world .
one is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we &apos;ve had and in all of the people here . just the variety of it and the range of it . the second is that it &apos;s put us in a place where we have no idea what &apos;s going to happen , in terms of the future . no idea how this may play out .
the teacher was fascinated and she went over to her and she said , &quot; what are you drawing ? &quot;
what we do know is , if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong , you &apos;ll never come up with anything original -- if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong . and by the time they get to be adults , most kids have lost that capacity .
anyway , he was really upset on the plane , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ll never find another girl like sarah . &quot;
they live up there , and slightly to one side .
if you didn &apos;t have a job it &apos;s because you didn &apos;t want one .
and the third thing about intelligence is , it &apos;s distinct . i &apos;m doing a new book at the moment called &quot; epiphany , &quot; which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent . i &apos;m fascinated by how people got to be there .
and he &apos;s right .
my job was to connect the brand with a middle eastern audience .
so i quickly went to work with a great team around me .
now , in three short years , we &apos;ve come a long way with stand-up comedy shows happening even in saudi arabia .
&quot; and now we go in content to liberty and not to banishment . &quot;
it &apos;s kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country .
i work for the federal government .
as we think about this , probably it &apos;s better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder , and that would be schizophrenia , because i think that &apos;s a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters .
thanks very much .
it was very difficult not to get scared , not to get daunted .
although they are like in different contexts , one is magical , the other two are like investigation , i like those books because they have something special in them .
now they have started writing their signature .
there they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset , a totally different society .
why is this happening ? why this confidence ?
so , parusharam comes to my office every day .
and one of his first clients was -- this is many years ago , back in the early &apos; 70s -- one of his first clients was pepsi .
they were looking for the perfect pepsi , and they should have been looking for the perfect pepsis . trust me .
and , anyway , despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence , and the quality of their tomato paste , prego was struggling .
and that &apos;s when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar , and 14 different kinds of mustard , and 71 different kinds of olive oil -- and then eventually even ragu hired howard , and howard did the exact same thing for ragu that he did for prego .
why is this critical ? it &apos;s critical because this is the way the food industry thought before howard . right ?
he fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste .
what is the great revolution in science of the last 10 , 15 years ?
and what i want to talk to you about today , and share with you , is that our healthcare system , our medical system , is just as bad at predicting what happens to people in it -- patients , others -- as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to billy beane .
we all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms for decades until all of a sudden we realized , because a study came out , a big one , nih-funded .
i &apos;m responsible .
ivan oransky : are we over-medicalized ?
so , he has four kids , right ?
and this third kind of vision , of something which can be , which may be , based on knowledge , but is as yet unproven .
put all these three together , and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comics can embrace .
interactivity was another thing .
and notice what &apos;s going on here .
because what you &apos;re looking at is , you &apos;re looking at comics cubed : you &apos;re looking at comics that are more comics-like than they &apos;ve ever been before .
i don &apos;t need a husband who wants to be . &quot;
on the other side of the political spectrum , the first time that i heard rush limbaugh refer to presidential hopeful john edwards as the breck girl i knew that he &apos;d made a direct hit .
and that &apos;s followed by these lines about gay adoption : what is the problem with gay adoption ?
and he used to be the usa today monday morning guy .
so my suggestion to those of you out here who are seriously focused on creating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and practice thinking funny , because you might just find the question that you &apos;ve been looking for .
how far back does that go ? how far back does modern language go ?
this animal is in &quot; the guinness world book of records &quot; for being the world &apos;s heaviest bony fish .
a single four-foot female had 300 million eggs , can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine -- and they get to be over 10 feet long . imagine what a 10 foot one has .
and it &apos;s pictured right here , that little tag up there .
not so many california sea lions down there .
they &apos;re not big migrators . this is their track : we deployed the tag off of tokyo , and the mola in one month kind of got into the kuroshio current off of japan and foraged there .
and to me that -- i don &apos;t think i could say it any better than the immortal bard himself : &quot; one touch of nature makes the whole world kin . &quot;
so as you can see here , this is a , eleven-inch diameter circuit board .
that &apos;s amazing .
to watch her better , the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree .
in india , only 25 percent of rapes come to a police station , and of these 25 percent that come to a police station , convictions are only in four percent of the cases .
and mr. berlusconi knows it , as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth .
well , somebody had a great idea .
chorus : one , two , three , four folds we make .
it &apos;s what made you smack your baby brother , stamp on a cockroach , scratch your mother .
and of course , &quot; the vagina monologues &quot; we know about .
he announced a swayamvara .
so it didn &apos;t happen . it was a dream that did not happen .
so june 1945 -- actually , the bomb hasn &apos;t even been dropped yet -- and von neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing , which also goes back to turing , who , before that , gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless , little , finite state machine , just reading a tape in and reading a tape out .
and this is von neumann and morgenstern , who wrote the &quot; theory of games . &quot;
this is the archetype of the hard disk that &apos;s in your machine now .
&quot; found trouble in code , i hope . &quot;
i know when i &apos;m licked . &quot;
so he designed this universe , and ran it .
so , when i went into these archives looking at this stuff , lo and behold , the archivist came up one day , saying , &quot; i think we found another box that had been thrown out . &quot;
that &apos;s the last entry in the logbook when the machine was shut down , july 1958 .
you lot , you &apos;re all right , but we &apos;ll get you eventually , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ve been doing this for seven years .
he gets bullied , for god &apos;s sake .
let &apos;s start with the main street .
and i need you to know that this is going to kill your children early .
but they &apos;re doing what they &apos;re told , and what they &apos;re being told to do is wrong .
jo : no . what do you think this is ? onion . jo : onion ? no .
it &apos;s in everything . even the milk hasn &apos;t escaped the kind of modern-day problems .
they owe us , to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket .
you know , it &apos;s now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff .
around america , if we just look back now , there is plenty of wonderful things going on .
we do not forgive . we do not forget .
okay , they &apos;re a little inchoate .
because it &apos;s a u.n. operation , of course , it lacks funding .
and the officer would then verify if the stolen credit card worked .
he knew no other way of making a living and making money .
and then finally , cagatay evyapan , aka cha0 -- one of the most remarkable hackers ever , from ankara in turkey .
they &apos;re just relentless and obsessive about what they do .
and those have been linked then with the rather alarming , growing rates of obesity , shown in these maps here , and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes .
that basically , the boomers want to be able to age in place , and gen y would like to live an urban lifestyle , but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia .
it &apos;s been so successful , they &apos;ve now taken over the strip across the street .
you can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new main street .
and so it &apos;s giving people more choices , but it &apos;s not taking away choices .
so i &apos;ve shown you some of the first generation of retrofits .
and they are public places , but that are managed by private companies .
i interviewed a high-powered businesswoman ; she told me she didn &apos;t have time .
in westchester they call it a &quot; pooky , &quot; in new jersey a &quot; twat . &quot;
but this wave started , and if i question the wave , or try to stop the wave or look back at the wave , i often have the experience of whiplash or the potential of my neck breaking . but if i go with the wave , and i trust the wave and i move with the wave , i go to the next place , and it happens logically and organically and truthfully .
it has taken me to juarez , mexico , where i was a week ago , where i have literally been there in parking lots where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to coca-cola bottles .
and at that time we did this extraordinary v-day at madison square garden where we sold out the entire testosterone-filled dome , 18,000 people standing up to say &quot; yes &quot; to vaginas , which was really a pretty incredible transformation .
when i was a little girl -- and i grew up in a wealthy community ; it was an upper-middle class white community , and it had all the trappings and the looks of a perfectly nice , wonderful , great life .
but there it is : &quot; yo napot , pacak ! &quot;
he built one plant after another .
and then in the late 1950s , in the aftermath of brown v. board of education , when the klan was resurgent all over the south , mr. teszler said , &quot; i have heard this talk before . &quot;
it was an achievement worthy of mahatma gandhi , conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint .
he &apos;s also a prodigious art collector , beginning as an intern in budapest by collecting 16th- and 17th-century dutch art and hungarian painting , and when he came to this country moving on to spanish colonial art , russian icons and finally mayan ceramics .
&quot; live each day as if it is your last , &quot; said mahatma gandhi .
there was an important lesson for me in that .
the exhibition was designed to be an experience , and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs .
it &apos;s in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations , the cultures , that we &apos;re seeing the current manifestation of .
you know it &apos;s an orgy .
pm : and the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic .
so if you beat your wife , you &apos;re going to be there .
my sister was different .
she shows us , trains us how to do and how to be better &#91; people &#93; and how to do long hours in surgery -- 300 patients per day , 10 , 20 surgeries , and still you have to manage the camp -- that &apos;s how she trains us .
ok . and what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to immerse ourselves in my world .
you know , we &apos;re going to do this , we &apos;re going to take it away from something else .
because it &apos;s along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating .
we punched a bunch of heat probes . everything made sense , except , at the axis , there was missing heat . it was missing heat .
none of it in our textbooks . none of this in our textbooks .
again , discovered by accident . just two years ago working off santorini , where people are sunning themselves on the beach , unbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby , we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and more life systems .
all their organics are perfectly preserved . we begin to excavate them .
and within that , we &apos;re going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine , blue-gold team , switching them off and on , running 24 hours a day .
watching exploration live from thousands of miles away , and it &apos;s just dawning on her what she &apos;s seeing .
there has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care .
we get unbelievable segregation .
you can see the deadlines and the usage graph .
so they get to try again , and this time they got it right .
it turns out that previous studies show , like this one by saddler and good , that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades .
and in the context of particular courses , you can ask questions like , what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them ?
mastery is easy to achieve using a computer , because a computer doesn &apos;t get tired of showing you the same video five times .
maybe the next albert einstein or the next steve jobs is living somewhere in a remote village in africa .
so it &apos;s actually drearier than self-love ; it &apos;s unrequited self-love .
that &apos;s why little girls don &apos;t do math . it &apos;s too depressing .
i know this because i read in the new york times , the ayn rand foundation took out a full-page ad after september 11 , in which they said , &quot; the problem is not iraq or iran , the problem in this country , facing this country is the university professors and their spawn . &quot;
and well , yeah .
and she says that roman humor mirrors the construction of roman society .
i mean he had laid it all out .
&quot; no , you take the prize .
this is what i tend to see almost more than contradictions .
i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;m getting like the woman in that joke about -- have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother ?
i like to think of what i do as a probability wave .
sp : i agree with the president .
secondly , drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs . we know that most mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with .
if we want humanity to last forever , we have to colonize the milky way .
this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about .
we have an electromagnetic field around the earth , and it &apos;s constantly bombarded by high-energy particles , like protons .
scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent .
and you just , literally , have to send little nuclear factories up there that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of mars and spit out the oxygen .
we have a real , major outbreak of disease in the united states , we are not prepared to cope with it .
in 1908 , just a 200-foot piece of a comet exploded over siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles .
because we can actually figure out every asteroid that &apos;s out there , and if it might hit earth , and when it might hit earth .
we know about this stuff .
and what i &apos;d like to talk to you today about , a little bit , is really transforming the relationship , or the interplay , between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet .
what do i mean by that ?
the age of the ocean , the tectonic plates , gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference .
but without data , those models will never ever be predicted .
and it &apos;s going to deliver abundant power and unprecedented bandwidth across this entire volume -- in the overlying ocean , on the sea floor and below the sea floor .
the kinds of systems that will be down there , the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor , consist of -- if you can read them there -- there &apos;s cameras , there &apos;s pressure sensors , fluorometers , there &apos;s seismometers .
grid computing : the power of grid computers is going to be just amazing here .
it &apos;s going to be amazing .
architecture is not based on concrete and steel and the elements of the soil .
and yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy .
you know the soviet architecture of that building is the conservation .
hand versus the computer .
and i &apos;ve always believed that the act of architecture , even a private house , when somebody else will see it , is a political act , because it will be visible to others .
and of course habits are enforced by architecture .
but i rather play something completely unheard of , and even with flaws , than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness .
risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent .
it &apos;s political . there is so many parties to this project .
and i believe that what will be built at ground zero will be meaningful , will be inspiring , will tell other generations of the sacrifices , of the meaning of this event .
there &apos;s just no way around newton &apos;s third law .
so we &apos;re at step two at this point .
what &apos;s unusual about that ?
em : typical leases are 20 years , but the value proposition is , as you &apos;re sort of alluding to , quite straightforward .
em : i made that bet , i think , two or three years ago , so in roughly 18 years , i think we &apos;ll see more power from solar than any other source .
there &apos;s a long list of innovations that we &apos;ve come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk , but -- not least because you could still get copied , right ?
so that &apos;s potentially absolutely disruptive technology , and , i guess , paves the way for your dream to actually take , at some point , to take humanity to mars at scale .
you bet your fortune on it , and you seem to have done that multiple times .
entrepreneur elon musk is a man with many plans . the founder of paypal , tesla motors and spacex sits down with curator chris anderson to share details about his visionary projects , which include a mass-marketed electric car , a solar energy leasing company and a fully reusable rocket .
&quot; and he will let go of the goat and run off . &quot;
i remember a night when a hungry leopard went into the house of one of our neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed .
here is our tradition : at every himba village , there is a sacred fire .
and most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in namibia have been trained through the initiative , through the involvement of world wildlife fund in the most up-to-date conservation practices .
this is our new economy -- an economy based on the respect of our natural resources .
it allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
i &apos;m going to drink so much of it . i &apos;m going to be so healthy .
forget nuclear holocaust ; it &apos;s the fork that we have to worry about .
people started buying appetizers and salads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entrees alone .
i expect health and joy and family and community .
but it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the communion we call dinner .
what do the computer models say about this , that and the other thing ?
we &apos;re working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere .
earth is having a fever .
but , in any case , the deflation of this glacier since 1984 has been higher than the eiffel tower , higher than the empire state building .
and here , if you watch , you can see the terminus retreating .
we had nine cameras going .
in fact , if you look at polls , they show a declining trend for support for free trade in the west .
and what we found was , as we progressed in our research , was , that we were asking really the wrong question .
for example , xcl technologies , they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new boeing 787 dreamliner , one to avoid collisions in the sky , and another to allow landing in zero visibility .
you can &apos;t be a consultant without having been a research associate .
the punch line ?
not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning i can find .
now do you need towels , laundry , maids ?
we might not ever know .
the best way to visualize an electric field is to think of gravity .
and we can observe this .
so these are patients who had received surgery , high dose radiation to the head and first-line chemotherapy , and that had failed and their tumors had grown back .
at this point , he was told by his doctors that he had about 3 months to live .
and every single morning i appreciate life .
and i firmly believe that in the next 10 years tumor treating fields will be a weapon available to doctors and patients for all of these most-difficult-to-treat solid tumors .
it &apos;s called kunds ; somewhere it is called &#91; unclear &#93; .
this is near jaipur . this is called the jaigarh fort .
of course there are some areas where water is reaching , i &apos;m not saying that it is not reaching at all .
or , if you want to paint , you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms .
this is called kund . we have , in english , surface water and ground water .
this was done in 11th century .
the center of life is water .
life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade .
does anyone recognize this ? in fact , they do .
a bit dangerous , sometimes .
he won by a margin .
that new cover shows , well , africa rising , because the growth over the last 10 years has been about five and a half percent .
and when i present this in africa -- nairobi , lagos , accra -- i get one question .
however , to my surprise , i discovered that dictatorships do not crumble so easily .
so you may wonder , why on earth are they doing it ?
we tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships , but in many cases it only strengthens them .
in the past it would take you weeks , if not months , to identify how iranian activists connect to each other .
evgeny morozov : how the net aids dictatorships
sit down , get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a -- &quot; what ?
at this time we &apos;re living in the bronx , and in the building next to where i lived there was a guy named johnny .
so i run right upstairs .
well actually , he raped her , but he would say he had sex with her .
i need you on board . i need you with me .
soft power is a concept invented by a harvard academic , joseph nye , a friend of mine .
if you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist , or a doctor or something , you might have a telephone .
fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones .
why ? because that was the moment when the indian television soap opera , &quot; kyunki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi , &quot; dubbed into dari , was telecast on tolo t.v .
it &apos;s a civilizational story to begin with .
and those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note , spelling out the denominations .
the limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
we realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want drybath .
what if i could stick this molecule , slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me , that had just invaded my lungs ?
that will know how to find staph when it &apos;s in your body , and will alert your immune system to go after it .
you would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer .
we became bald-bodied , oddly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s a neural system that &apos;s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job .
lots of laughter , quite a bit of embarrassment .
don &apos;t know the reason for the pink flamingos , but anyway , they &apos;re there in the garden .
there we go .
and there &apos;s a reason for that : we want to settle on an answer .
so another one of bob mckim &apos;s favorite exercises is called the &quot; 30 circles test . &quot;
we self-edit as we &apos;re having ideas .
but really , it wasn &apos;t the drugs that were important ; it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking , and getting them to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas .
now , david kelley calls this behavior , when it &apos;s carried out by designers , &quot; thinking with your hands . &quot;
this is a nurse using a very simple -- as you can see -- plasticine prototype , explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her in a hospital .
so we &apos;re very good , when acting out a solution , at spotting whether something lacks authenticity .
in short , we admire their willingness to play .
and i think it &apos;s probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness .
but then i stopped because i figured , &quot; hey , i &apos;m good enough .
and yeah , the black cloud faded a little bit , but so did all the work , because i was just floating along . i couldn &apos;t care less if clients ever called .
richard st. john : success is a continuous journey
in my entire life i had seen in black and white , and suddenly everything was in shocking technicolor .
and i made free the download of the music to a piece that i had written in the year 2000 called &quot; lux aurumque , &quot; which means &quot; light and gold . &quot;
and then we posted this video to youtube about a year and a half ago .
and there were 900 people involved in that .
it doesn &apos;t matter the technology .
my values can be radically different from your values .
the effects that you &apos;re having with the device , like less fuel , as well as the effects of the actual tools you &apos;re using to get people to do things -- public recognition .
is it &quot; still &quot; permissible ?
whatever we do or refrain from doing , whatever we put out there as a piece of design into the world has a persuasive component .
why , when the question of what the good life is informs everything that we design , should we stop at design and not ask ourselves , how does it apply to our own life ?
so we got to work .
you can watch them any time you want .
but to me , the most exciting part of it is the data that we &apos;re gathering .
he wiggles it in place , tugs it with his nose , and smash .
and so what we did is , we took a look at these videos , and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question .
and this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while .
that &apos;s a bit long , but it is sort of interesting .
but there &apos;s a really large second peak half a millisecond later , and i didn &apos;t know what that was .
and these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring , but the extremes of the fluid dynamics . and they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail .
sheila patek : the shrimp with a kick !
the ocean representation would have a depth to it .
a seat works in a two-dimensional world , where gravity blasts down on that seat , ok ?
and the craft that i &apos;m in -- this hasn &apos;t been shown before .
i don &apos;t really look that ugly , but the camera is so close that it &apos;s just distorted .
so we &apos;ve run two flight schools .
so now i want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war , and that is the eastern oyster .
finally , oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures .
you can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them .
they were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an elizabethan public infrastructure .
you can &apos;t really see it in this map , but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book .
and that was the last time that london has seen a cholera outbreak since .
so i took this picture three days after she arrived , and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on , with her toes sticking out .
and they live up on the chang tang , the tibetan plateau , way in the western part of the country .
this was on a monkey hunt , hunting with curare-tipped darts .
and we watched and stayed with john doolikahn .
the other thing : i wanted to give indigenous people a voice .
it &apos;s a question of what &apos;s the continuity ?
put the earth at the center of the nested spheres , just because that &apos;s where we &apos;re making observations .
and then you see this sort of model area around the outside , and that is the radiation coming from the big bang , which is actually incredibly uniform .
and you see these structures , this thing we call the great wall , but there are voids and those kinds of stuff , and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn &apos;t sensitive enough to do it .
that is , we have to seriously play god , not just change people &apos;s lives , but make the universe , right .
so we &apos;re zooming in .
it &apos;s only when you look at it at a very large scale , and explore it and so forth , you realize it &apos;s a very intricate , complicated kind of a design , right ?
the fluctuations are a part in 100,000 .
give you a different view about what the design and what everything else looks like .
so i was about 11 when i went along to my first meditation class .
forty-seven percent .
oh , i really am worried . wow , there &apos;s so much anxiety . &quot;
this was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist .
and then when i got home , i sat down and i set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box .
this destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that i called goodbye art , where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation .
now , when i run into a barrier or i find myself creatively stumped , i sometimes still struggle , but i continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities , like using hundreds of real , live worms to make an image , using a pushpin to tattoo a banana , or painting a picture with hamburger grease .
they did so illegally .
and there is a kind of heroic resilience , a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at 5 a.m .
the power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative .
now fast-forward to 2012 .
we &apos;re getting used to a new way of being alone together .
we get to edit , and that means we get to delete , and that means we get to retouch , the face , the voice , the flesh , the body -- not too little , not too much , just right .
and one day i came in and a woman who had lost a child was talking to a robot in the shape of a baby seal .
we are not so much in control .
solitude is where you find yourself so that you can reach out to other people and form real attachments .
do the same thing at work .
sherry turkle : connected , but alone ?
i believe that &apos;s true . if you make the effort to do the best of which you &apos;re capable , to try and improve the situation that exists for you , i think that &apos;s success .
i knew him once , but then he was a boy .
because you &apos;ll go home in a bad mood .
and i believe that we must have faith .
just get out there , and whatever you &apos;re doing , do it to the best of your ability .
i &apos;d want one to realize that defense usually wins championships , and would work hard on defense .
john wooden : the difference between winning and succeeding
the second challenge was cells .
the cells genetically know what to do , and they start beating together .
you can hold it like a liver , but it has no cells ; it &apos;s just a skeleton of the liver .
because in reality , our biggest challenge are the solid organs .
and this is actually a new technology we &apos;re working on now .
i went through about 16 surgeries , and it seemed impossible to do that when i was in kidney failure when i was 10 .
on our shelves at home , we have a box set of the dvd series &quot; 24 , &quot; season six to be precise .
namely , that technology is enabling trust between strangers .
it &apos;s second nature to them .
the second is collaborative lifestyles .
in 2009 , zipcar took 250 participants from across 13 cities -- and they &apos;re all self-confessed car addicts and car-sharing rookies -- and got them to surrender their keys for a month .
now in the old consumer system , our reputation didn &apos;t matter so much , because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer-to-peer review .
so i said to myself , with all these hundred other boys , this is where i belong .
the blind man said , &quot; look , i &apos;m a very strong man but i can &apos;t see . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to develop homegrown solutions to our issues because we realize that people from outside can come and help us , but if we don &apos;t help ourselves , there &apos;s nothing we can do .
so i get the call from caitria , i hear the news , and i start tracking the radar online to call the family back when another supercell was forming in their area .
we don &apos;t need any more freezers .
systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time .
and you &apos;ve only got about four days of interest in dallas .
mo : it &apos;s not rocket science .
they are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow , the new urban world .
this was southland , a small shanty community on the western side of nairobi , kenya .
&apos;this place is very addictive , &apos; he had said .
that &apos;s also in istanbul , turkey .
people burn trash to get rid of the garbage , and they dig their own sewer channels .
that &apos;s sureka gundi ; she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median .
little did i know , lying curled up in my prim baby humidicrib in 1948 that i &apos;d been born at the right place and the right time , that i was in a country where i could participate in the technological revolution .
well , i went back and became an academic at melbourne &apos;s monash university , and for those 25 years , tape recorders were everything to me .
optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font , but by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers , he developed a machine that could read any font .
this technology that fascinated me in 1987 is now on my iphone and on yours as well .
there are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the united states , britain , canada , australia , etc . , but they can &apos;t be transported to the 60 countries in our world where english is the first and the second language .
this is the world we live in .
and the avian flu is also not a good idea .
for example , mobile humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive , but the research arm of the defense department just launched a competition to have them do things like this , and if the track record is any guide , this competition is going to be successful .
the first are economic , and they &apos;re really nicely summarized in an apocryphal story about a back-and-forth between henry ford ii and walter reuther , who was the head of the auto workers union .
and if you go back about 50 years , bill and ted were leading remarkably similar lives .
i do know that education is a huge part of it .
and if we do enough of these kinds of things , the awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different .
of course , there have been thinkers who have suggested different ways of looking at god .
in some way , god must feel the anguish , and grief , and physical pain that we feel .
in the second verse comes the line , &quot; the wind and waves obey him . &quot;
such a god would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity .
the people knew their god by his mighty acts .
if we knew , god would not be god .
tom honey : why would god create a tsunami ?
so , another way to think about technology , what it means , is to imagine a world without technology .
but when the scarcity came when the highs and lows and the droughts came , then people went into starvation .
but of course we &apos;re not done yet .
and the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a pc chip .
when king henry of england died , he had 18,000 things in his house , but that was the entire wealth of england .
so , maybe spraying ddt on crops is a really bad idea .
i really appreciate your attention today . thank you .
you &apos;d have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers .
we took all that down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , whitewashed beams and it had the look -- while we were renovating this place , somebody said , &quot; you know , it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
and we thought , &quot; oh , they &apos;re going to storm the gates , they &apos;re gonna love it . &quot; and they didn &apos;t .
they go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel -- because we had very gifted kids , too .
you just point a camera at a class , and it always looks like this .
this is their newspaper , the &quot; straight-up news , &quot; that has an ongoing column from mayor gavin newsom in both languages -- english and spanish .
and maybe this is just a san francisco thing -- i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t want to judge .
so they opened this place . inside , it &apos;s like a costco for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form .
so it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school .
now i &apos;m going to the ted wish -- is that okay ?
students and parents need you . they need your actual person : your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion , sitting next to them , listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time .
you see , i grew up in war-torn iraq , and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we &apos;ve only seen one side of it .
how casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic .
and the ones who are keeping that life are women .
did you know that one year of the world &apos;s military spending equals 700 years of the u.n. budget and equals 2,928 years of the u.n. budget allocated for women ?
i humbly add -- humbly add -- that out beyond the worlds of war and peace , there is a field , and there are many women and men &#91; who &#93; are meeting there .
so i went and bought khaki shorts or whatever , and unfortunately , their branding was all about &quot; keep it simple . &quot;
we &apos;re human beings : we love complex things .
school was great , and maybe going to school helped me get to this media lab place , i &apos;m not sure .
the t doesn &apos;t stand for &quot; human , &quot; it stands for &quot; technology . &quot;
lastly , this is a fall-based calendar , because i have so many leaves in my yard .
but i thought , &quot; this is very interesting . what if i make like a car crash test ? &quot;
people ask me how they make the antenna .
because i want to simplify them for you .
he &apos;s an expert in aging . this horizontal axis is how old you are -- twelve years old , twenty-four years old , seventy-four , ninety-six years old -- and this is some medical data . so , brain strength increases up to 60 , and then after 60 , it sort of goes down . kind of depressing in a way .
perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism .
this is what &apos;s happened in the last 28 years .
what is missing is a sense of urgency .
this is not pie in the sky ; this can be done .
this was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet .
demand -- change the light bulbs , but change the laws . change the global treaties .
new thinking on the climate crisis
but according to a really great science historian you might know , peter galison -- he teaches at harvard -- what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed interest , this real passion for design .
so , tissue design .
you see here the work of ben fry . this is &quot; human vs. chimps &quot; -- the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps .
rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine .
and so this student at the rca designed this beautiful blown-glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies , in this case , pregnancy .
so it &apos;s a series of dolls that he &apos;s working on right now .
if we can get enough of these streams of information together , we can perhaps start to understand the war .
why should there be order in war ?
and we start running the numbers on this . can we simulate it ?
and we see the evolution of alpha through time .
i love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life .
there are others who feel they can &apos;t confront compassion anymore , and so they turn off the television and don &apos;t watch .
the idea of justice , which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what &apos;s right about life , what &apos;s right about living , what should we be doing , social justice .
what &apos;s matzah ? what &apos;s unleavened bread ? you don &apos;t get it .
god , the one who rules the entire universe , wants my bread ? &quot;
and then i have to try to see in what ways i can make these the hands of god .
that was the experience of my patient , chandler , whom you see in the photograph .
but the situation , of course , in the human body is far more complicated than that .
so i have hope that in the future , the prophetic words of george carlin will be realized , who said , &quot; my philosophy : no pain , no pain . &quot;
it was huge . to give you a sense of the scale , okay , there you go . the scale here is 50 miles on top , a hundred kilometers on the bottom . this thing was 300 kilometers across -- 200 miles -- an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet , threw up enough dust to block out the sun .
another rock came into the earth &apos;s atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground , several miles up above the surface of the earth .
but you can see that it &apos;s extremely faint .
well , let me ask you , what happens if you &apos;re standing in the middle of the road and a car &apos;s headed for you ? what do you do ? you do this .
well , my opinion is , fine . okay ?
if anybody here is a fan of the original &quot; star trek , &quot; they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive , and spock said , &quot; they &apos;re very technically sophisticated .
think about that number : 83 percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries .
we were actually recording history .
somebody must have started something like that .
you see banks -- i don &apos;t know if there are any bankers over here ; i apologize in advance -- but it &apos;s the best job in the world .
it &apos;s not a bank . we had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them -- by establishing management systems , by providing all that knowledge , how do you run a business on one side -- while they all know how to run , how to create content .
after two years working with us , he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place .
40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries .
but the point is , if we ever survive to actually issue them , find enough investors that this can be considered a success , there &apos;s nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring .
thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here .
i &apos;ll try to make that clear -- partially clear .
now , some people call that a theory of everything .
and the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin .
but you can just look at the form . you can look at the form .
symmetry exhibits the simplicity .
so we don &apos;t have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates .
whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication , is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement , but with serenity .
it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s .
for one thing , he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples &apos; point of view .
he told them everything he could about lincoln .
i like to believe it was because i was a good listener .
and yet , years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family , in recreation , in sports or in hobbies .
and so they said , &quot; well , did you see george washington in there ? &quot;
he said , &quot; don &apos;t worry . he &apos;s speaking in a parish hall .
and i must say , even now , when i sit with my sons with our season tickets , i can sometimes close my eyes against the sun and imagine myself , a young girl once more , in the presence of my father , watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below : jackie robinson , roy campanella , pee wee reese , and duke snider .
what you &apos;re looking at is rembrandt &apos;s painting , now in the national gallery in london , illustrating the text from the prophet daniel in the hebrew scriptures .
he goes on to say that , having conquered babylon , he will at once let all the peoples that the babylonians -- nebuchadnezzar and belshazzar -- have captured and enslaved go free .
it was the largest empire the world had known until then .
we only knew about the return of the jews and the decree of cyrus from the hebrew scriptures .
and there &apos;s a slight sense that isaiah knows this , because he says , this is god speaking , of course , &quot; i have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me . &quot;
and the obvious emblem is cyrus .
it certainly says far more about real freedoms than magna carta .
they are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children &apos;s cleverness .
the child &apos;s daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing , and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling , the walls or the bars of their cots .
across europe , a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community-based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential . when i first started to work in romania nearly 20 years ago , there were 200,000 children living in institutions , and more entering every day .
and at that point , i read a book by frank barnaby , this wonderful nuclear physicist , and he said that media had a responsibility , that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward .
i was living at my mom &apos;s place .
and actually , let me go back to that slide , because when we launched it in 1999 -- this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence -- we invited thousands of people .
76 countries in the last 12 years , i &apos;ve visited .
that was an incredible moment .
and that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways , because it couldn &apos;t not work .
while i was filming these statements , he said to me , &quot; where are you going next ? &quot;
and i got home , and i remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the taliban .
and i remember being stuck in new york , this time because of the volcano , which was obviously much less harmful .
so , utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action .
by working together , we can create peace one day .
it seems quite vexing .
i &apos;ve been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number , and i could never find it .
and there , if you do the math , you find that a generic primate with 86 billion neurons would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos , which seems just right , in a body of some 66 kilos , which in my case is exactly right , which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion : i am a primate .
one way out of this metabolic limitation would be to spend even more hours per day eating , but that gets dangerous , and past a certain point , it &apos;s just not possible .
and i think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
and she talked about how technology with these new feathers , this new face paint , this punk , the way that we identify with the world , and we made this music video .
we do more than that .
anyway , in 1992 , the mujahideen took all afghanistan .
why don &apos;t you have the artificial legs ? &quot;
and the gatekeeper told me , &quot; they come everyday to see if the center will open . &quot;
and najmuddin was staying there , doing everything and reporting on the patients .
mahmoud grabbed his son , i grabbed someone else .
he was clearly embarrassed .
we need to employ someone to glue and to screw the sole of the feet .
he was a new man , taller again .
so you do vocational training , home education for those who cannot go to school .
i never miss a single training session .
anesthetic wears off . the patient feels pain .
we had just had a military coup , and soldiers were pervasive in our society .
you know , the faculty there didn &apos;t want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as i was used to back in ghana .
these things were provided by institutions run by the people that i call leaders .
very little emphasis on ethics , and the typical graduate from a university in ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility .
this year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves .
and every single one of them has been placed .
and what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us .
but what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe .
i know you &apos;re out there , they told me backstage , it &apos;s a full house and such .
but there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychic , magical powers that they can predict the future , that they can make contact with the deceased .
now , she could easily have said , &quot; oh , it &apos;s in the library on the second shelf , behind the encyclopedia , &quot; but she doesn &apos;t say that . no , she doesn &apos;t .
now , these people will make guesses , they &apos;ll say things like , &quot; why am i getting electricity ?
because , the bottom line is , the sponsors love it , and he will expose her to television publicity all the time .
duh .
why don &apos;t they affect me ?
these people don &apos;t need the million dollars perhaps , but wouldn &apos;t you think they &apos;d like to take it just to make me look silly ?
oh , we get lots of them , hundreds of them every year come by .
in other words , this machine requires a lot of stuff that this hospital cannot offer .
and now in the middle of this surgery , the surgeon is racing against the clock to finish his case , which he can do -- he &apos;s got a headlamp .
but so in here when there &apos;s electricity , the oxygen concentrator takes in room air .
and so it &apos;s not going to break very easily , but if it does , virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver .
but you know , it &apos;s just one of so many ways that design , appropriate design , can have an impact on health outcomes .
these secret societies of the yoruba , kongo and palo religions in nigeria , congo and angola respectively , developed this intricate writing system which is alive and well today in the new world in cuba , brazil and trinidad and haiti .
it is also time that designers in africa stop looking outside .
there &apos;s more .
what do they have in common ?
but there &apos;s no way to treat animals well , when you &apos;re killing 10 billion of them a year .
and fancy food was entirely french .
now , i know everybody over the age of , like 45 -- their mouths are watering at this point .
my mom is not here , so i can say this now .
so , now we clamor for organic food .
the most common argument is that we need nutrients -- even though we eat , on average , twice as much protein as even the industry-obsessed usda recommends .
we can continue the search for the ingredients we love , and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals .
and i &apos;d commit to doing it later , and not surprisingly , later never came .
&#91; beautiful &#93; &#91; intriguing &#93; so you don &apos;t have to say a lot .
remember ? he did a horrible thing , condemned for all time to roll this rock up , it would roll back down , roll back up , roll back down .
thank you .
i just look at the information , and knowledge , and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general , and aging , in particular .
i said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have .
and it &apos;s really difficult to recall , in a normal frame of mind , just how good life can be at its best .
they do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition , but for most people , they don &apos;t really transform what it is to be human .
it &apos;s just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with , and to remember what you have learned .
it &apos;s been done in voles .
i had the question popped into my head : what does the cone that connects the sun and the earth look like if you could connect the two spheres ?
but the paintings become very complex , because i think the fields that are supporting them , they &apos;re billowing , and they &apos;re interpenetrating , and they &apos;re interference patterns .
and i keep it around for a couple of weeks , and i &apos;m contemplating it , and i &apos;ll do another session with it and bring it up to another level , where all of this becomes the background , the depth of it .
ts : it is the paint actually , makes it real .
i &apos;m left-handed , and so i draw .
so we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free .
and we were shocked .
and my dad is the most voracious reader i know .
and great art would have &quot; head &quot; : it would have interesting intellectual ideas and concepts .
nell is interested in agricultural processes , and her work is based in these practices .
and you buy one , and maybe you get a real piece , and maybe not .
so he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them , and they crafted his nests for him .
and so we got to the grave and made this , which was hilarious -- the attention that we got .
she created the swiss people named the uvulites , and they have this distinctive yodeling song that they use the uvula for .
and that &apos;s my cousin and my sister &apos;s dog , gabby .
shea hembrey : how i became 100 artists
this , too , is origami , and this shows where we &apos;ve gone in the modern world .
but indeed , the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin , and yet they govern all of chemistry , all of life , all of history .
now the first step , pretty easy .
so , no matter how i make a flap , it needs some part of a circular region of paper .
we found we could do insects , spiders , which are close , things with legs , things with legs and wings , things with legs and antennae .
surprisingly , origami and the structures that we &apos;ve developed in origami turn out to have applications in medicine , in science , in space , in the body , consumer electronics and more .
folded lens , you divide up the panels , you add flexures .
and that leads to a really interesting idea .
we had a lot that got us excited .
over 50 percent of managers are women these days , and in the 15 professions projected to grow the most in the next decade , all but two of them are dominated by women .
the first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men -- that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy .
this has been going on for 40 years now .
you would tell everyone below you what to do .
because i &apos;m writing a book about all this , i &apos;m still looking into it , so i don &apos;t have the answer .
so who were they ?
how much do you prefer a first-born son ?
so the image that i like to think of , instead of glass ceiling , is the high bridge .
he talked about how the mandalas of ancient hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war .
we know the temples they built , where people could come to experience a different reality .
whether it &apos;s mathematics or music , it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before .
there &apos;s this focus that , once it becomes intense , leads to a sense of ecstasy , a sense of clarity : you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other ; you get immediate feedback .
unfortunately , a lot of people &apos;s experience is in apathy .
then i &apos;m very much of the united states , and i have been for 48 years now , since i was a really small child .
because when my grandparents were born , they pretty much had their sense of home , their sense of community , even their sense of enmity , assigned to them at birth , and didn &apos;t have much chance of stepping outside of that .
and potentially , everything about the way that young woman dreams about the world , writes about the world , thinks about the world , could be something different , because it comes out of this almost unprecedented blend of cultures .
the whole place was absolutely silent , but the silence wasn &apos;t an absence of noise .
but i do think it &apos;s only by stopping movement that you can see where to go .
so now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things , we started to realize that , essentially , anything that we can do with paper , anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics .
and this gap between the west and the rest has created a mindset of the world , which we still use linguistically when we talk about &quot; the west &quot; and &quot; the developing world . &quot;
i was in shanghai recently , and i listened to what &apos;s happening in china , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will catch up , just as japan did .
the yellow on there is the americas ; dark blue is africa ; brown is europe ; green is the middle east and this light blue is south asia .
well , i &apos;m not an optimist , neither am i a pessimist .
and of course , they were right .
but if you give people vitamin d supplements , you don &apos;t change that high rate of heart disease .
we thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death , and how cells survive , and their resistance to other things .
now , we &apos;re still collecting data .
and you can look -- so , if you live on the equator , the sun comes straight overhead , it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere .
so , thank you very much indeed .
we &apos;ve talked about stem cells tonight .
it basically wants to fight off infection , and seal itself , whether it &apos;s organs inside your body , or your skin , the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in , so , how can we harness that power ?
it &apos;s bringing the cells into the body . it &apos;s allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue , and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away .
more complex structures such as blood vessels , urethras , which i showed you , they &apos;re definitely more complex because you &apos;re introducing two different cell types .
but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .
and this is actually still , of course , experimental , not for use in patients .
one of the things that i wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we &apos;re going for in regenerative medicine .
so , i always like to show this cartoon .
and that is really very simple , to make our patients better .
i think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish -- the old parable : &quot; if you give a man a fish , you feed him for a day .
so this thing right here is freaking me out .
but kids , you can see these signs in them .
and i learned that you could actually negotiate with people .
and then i would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids .
i saw there was money in garbage .
remember , i was being groomed to do this . i was not allowed to have jobs .
so i just packaged them . i &apos;m like 12 , right ?
and i remember that lesson to this day .
don &apos;t read them bedtime stories every night .
some of the entrepreneurial traits that you &apos;ve got to nurture in kids : attainment , tenacity , leadership , introspection , interdependence , values .
the story begins in the late &apos; 90s .
what kind of a world should we be making ?
incredibly , this nation , with all its material , intellectual and spiritual resources , seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas .
the value of the past also comes alive ; it provides a lot of company .
this is a political education , to be sure .
so what do you do when you feel overwhelmed ?
that &apos;s it . please save this .
and the second great thing about conservatives : they get ecology .
they are acting in the sense that they &apos;re emulating the original mashup .
all right , take for example this great company .
and we should remember who employed the sharecroppers : the democrats , right ?
but then i went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced .
the value of freedom . it &apos;s a value of community .
when we track them down and ask them what &apos;s going on , they say something like , &quot; i &apos;m just not the creative type . &quot;
and then many more steps later , baby steps , they &apos;d be in the room , they &apos;d have a leather glove like a welder &apos;s glove on , and they &apos;d eventually touch the snake .
but at one point he had a moment of crisis .
he was with one of the mothers waiting for her child to come out of the scan .
we see them come up with more interesting , and just more , ideas so they can choose from better ideas .
and i believe the answer is yes .
the rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago , and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco-engineers , and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to .
he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building &apos;s resident microbial landscape .
and so he suggested a machine , and he called it the memex .
so this is where the mouse came from as well .
and i thought , well , that &apos;s got a pretentious name , especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office .
basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web . you find some interesting content , say a tedtalk , submit it to reddit , and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it , vote it down if they don &apos;t .
which is pretty impressive right ? we won ! mister splashy pants was chosen . hmm , just kidding . okay .
but this wasn &apos;t really out of altruism . this was just out of interest in doing something cool .
in gando , there was no electricity , no access to clean drinking water , and no school .
when i came home to gando to bring the good news , my people were over the moon , but when they realized that i was planning to use clay , they were shocked .
so i could do a lot of projects , and here i am going to share with you only three of them .
the innovation in this project is to cast mud like you cast concrete .
yes , you know it .
they &apos;re a little bigger . they &apos;re a prototype .
mt : oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
mt : yeah , but i guess my hand is better . we beat the odds .
it &apos;s an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
it &apos;s never been the case .
one nation , one system .
now we in the west overwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least -- that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
i mean , take the question of east asia .
but this , alas , is no longer true .
the little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , christopher columbus crossed the atlantic .
i had a plan , and i never ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo .
and i &apos;ve collaborated with so many incredible , inspirational musicians around the world .
fellow abigail washburn wanted to be a lawyer improving us-china relations -- until she picked up a banjo . she tells a moving story of the remarkable connections she &apos;s formed touring across the united states and china while playing that banjo and singing in chinese .
so when i found a cheap camera on the subway , i started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies -- really small photos just that size .
so it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television .
we launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever .
&quot; well , yeah , yeah , that &apos;s part of the project . &quot;
most of the places i went to , i decided to go there because i &apos;ve heard about it through the media .
after that day , everyone in the favela gave me the green light .
i mean , they want to know what you &apos;re up to .
and i went there a few months ago -- photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye .
for each project we do a film .
and i was even invited to cover the moca museum .
art can change the way we see the world .
it &apos;s essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff , with the things in our lives .
how many people here have experienced car-sharing or bike-sharing ?
and so it &apos;s not only an option for them , but i believe it &apos;s an imperative for zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us , to be like a concierge service .
the opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses -- and those are businesses like zipcar or netflix that are full mesh businesses , or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies , car manufacturers , who are beginning to offer their own car-share services as well as a second flanker brand , or as really a test , i think -- is to make sharing irresistible .
that space is not vital .
they had some number of big successes .
income has gone up for a majority of the world &apos;s population , despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period .
this is a dust mite on a nanoreplica .
this would imply a massive leap in migration .
it is vital that we do so .
she &apos;s the one who taught me how to draw and , more importantly , how to love .
i saw layers of security .
he invited me to his studio . he said , &quot; come and visit . &quot;
that &apos;s pepe linares , the renowned flamenco singer .
american education is so expensive .
i &apos;m joking .
we were in the papers , we &apos;re still in the news three years later , but , unfortunately , something tragic happened right after .
i was very upset .
so netra and i wound up our life , closed up everything we had , and we decided to move to new york .
and then i left .
e : achoo !
if the children of the uganda need another dance partner , einstein could sure fit the bill , because she loves to dance .
you like to drink water .
sw : what about the other birds ?
sw : yeah . you are a superstar .
i was born premature . i was always very small .
so , moving onward .
the body is denser than water . 95 percent of it would be , at least , submerged naturally .
in freestyle , easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll , and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water .
and a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper .
you can also do this with grammar .
so i did my best . i didn &apos;t know where to put my hands .
then one month later , went to the world championships , made it to the semi-final . and then set a world record , following that , two weeks later .
and the best results that i &apos;ve had in life , the most enjoyable times , have all been from asking a simple question : what &apos;s the worst that can happen ?
and after hundreds of conversations with teenagers and teachers and parents and employers and schools from paraguay to australia , and looking at some of the academic research , which showed the importance of what &apos;s now called non-cognitive skills -- the skills of motivation , resilience -- and that these are as important as the cognitive skills -- formal academic skills -- we came up with an answer , a very simple answer in a way , which we called the studio school .
it &apos;s happened almost entirely without big money behind it .
and in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities of that region , so jerusalem , bethlehem , hebron .
and saul says , &quot; you can &apos;t fight him . that &apos;s ridiculous .
but most importantly , we call him an underdog because all he has is -- it &apos;s that goliath is outfitted with all of this modern weaponry , this glittering coat of armor and a sword and a javelin and a spear , and all david has is this sling .
saul has the same expectation .
he &apos;s not even carrying a sword .
because he can &apos;t make his way on his own .
what i thought about was , what caused the diabetes ?
we have millions of genes of microbes in our human microbiome covering us .
and a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system , helps in fighting off pathogens , helps in our metabolism , and determining our metabolic rate , probably determines our odor , and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways .
we should view it as a functioning organ , part of ourselves .
but if you know anything about the history of britannica since 1962 , it was anything but radical : still a very completely safe , stodgy type of encyclopedia .
this shows the growth of wikipedia -- we &apos;re the blue line there -- and then this is the new york times over there .
but when we &apos;ve seen quality tests -- and there haven &apos;t been enough of these yet and i &apos;m really encouraging people to do more , comparing wikipedia to traditional things -- we win hands down .
so the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point-of-view policy .
so we do have edits by anonymous users , which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about wikipedia .
but you can imagine there &apos;s a lot of other areas where the question is , is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia ?
so the wikipedia governance model , the governance of the community , is a very confusing , but a workable mix of consensus -- meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles , because the majority view is not necessarily neutral .
of course , the vote ended up being about 85 to 18 , so there was no real danger to our democratic processes .
and that &apos;s a much bigger project ; it &apos;s going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition .
after 1,300 years , these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb .
pain and more pain -- where are you going with my love ?
you can &apos;t stop thinking about another human being .
it &apos;s also the brain region that becomes active when you &apos;re willing to take enormous risks for huge gains and huge losses .
so , one thing i would like the medical community , and the legal community , and even the college community , to see if they can understand , that indeed , romantic love is one of the most addictive substances on earth .
i know what happens in the brain , when you do become in love , but i don &apos;t know why you fall in love with one person rather than another .
women get intimacy from face-to-face talking .
the area near these walls , which nobody bothers to pay attention to , had been left free from major intervention , and this is where i first found my treasures .
this is a picture of korean traditional bows taken from a museum , and see how my bow resembles them .
now i &apos;m interested in dolphins because of their large brains and what they might be doing with all that brainpower in the wild .
and dolphins are very promiscuous , and so we have to determine who the fathers are , so we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material out of the water and extracting dna .
and these are very unstudied sounds because they &apos;re hard to measure .
this underwater keyboard in orlando , florida , at the epcot center , was actually the most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water and exchange information .
now this is video of a session .
whoop . almost lost it .
i mean , imagine what it would be like to really understand the mind of another intelligent species on the planet .
and the song is based on what i think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces .
there is no turning back now .
and especially when you take a tracking position , you have the feeling that you are flying .
what kind of training do you do , you personally , for that ?
and this is my life .
and you don &apos;t look like a crazy guy ; you &apos;re a swiss airline pilot , so you &apos;re rather a checklist kind of guy .
so just as a curiosity , where did you land when you flew over the grand canyon ?
thanks to the increasing technology , better technology , it will be safe .
that ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists was achieved through these same theories that explained starlight and other ancient mysteries , and new , unexpected phenomena .
at the time , what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen , known as empiricism .
and the evidence for evolution ?
hades , god of the underworld , kidnaps persephone , the goddess of spring , and negotiates a forced marriage contract , requiring her to return regularly , and lets her go .
this easy variability is the sign of a bad explanation , because , without a functional reason to prefer one of countless variants , advocating one of them , in preference to the others , is irrational .
that the truth consists of hard to vary assertions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world .
what i want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses .
but the cost has to be brought right down .
the show is a collaboration with a u.k.-based performance company called lone twin .
rimini protokoll chooses 100 people that represent that city at that moment in terms of race and gender and class , through a careful process that begins three months before , and then those 100 people share stories about themselves and their lives , and the whole thing becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment .
lyn gardner in the guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world , a map of the city and a map of ourselves , but there is no one fixed festival model .
second doctor : we &apos;re gonna take this nice and easy , jake.first doctor : well , do you want to sit up ? that &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s a spirit bear , or a kermode bear .
you glaze over with it .
but unfortunately , 95 percent of the glaciers in the arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem .
and i &apos;ve come up , and all i wanted to do was get out of the water .
and the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods .
you get 12 tourists packed into a zodiac , floating in these icy waters , and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon .
and now you &apos;ve got to deliver .
i was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding , because i was crying underwater , just because it was so amazing .
she chased that big seal away , went and got its penguin and brought it to me .
great . double-check .
for me , i like to call him frank .
it &apos;s hard to tell where to start , there &apos;s so many great things .
now you have your money in your front pocket here ? joe : yup .
joe , we &apos;re going to keep doing this till you catch it .
did you see it go ?
what am i wearing ?
i &apos;m very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators .
and in kenya , it &apos;s a very different reality , and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress and the digital revolution is the electricity problem .
it &apos;s actually everywhere .
juliana rotich : meet brck , internet access built for africa
and this gets me back to my research .
on the left , it &apos;s when it &apos;s cold and the thermo-bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks , and on the right , the thermo-bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through , so those are two different components that i &apos;m working on , and again , it &apos;s a completely different thing , because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows .
this trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join .
now , because i know -- -- ok , i assume that answers my question .
the second foundation is fairness / reciprocity .
but as my son , max , grows up in a liberal college town , how is this first draft going to get revised ?
notice also that on all of these graphs , the slope is steeper on in-group , authority , purity .
of course , bosch called this hell .
i think that &apos;s probably right , although this is a controversial issue .
this guy &apos;s shirt says , &quot; stop bitching , start a revolution . &quot;
the struggle between for and against is the mind &apos;s worst disease . &quot;
but there is also a passionate commitment to the truth .
so if they had non-lethal weapons then they would say , &quot; well we can use them in that sort of situation .
yes , you don &apos;t have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different .
and the red arrow represents the point where queensland actually said , &quot; yes , this is where we &apos;re going to give all police officers across the entire state access to o.c. spray . &quot;
one of the fundamental principles of military use of force is that you have to be discriminate .
so this non-lethal weapon was being used , in fact , in this case as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation .
just in case you think it &apos;s only going to happen in the united states , it happened in canada as well .
i really believe that .
where did you guys get those ?
choir : i &apos;m hooked on a feelin &apos; i &apos;m high on believin &apos; that you &apos;re in love with me dd : so richard came up from houston last year to visit us in detroit here and show the wonderful sashimi tabernacle choir .
dd : so it goes on to show you people making things out of wood , a grandfather making a ship in a bottle , a woman making a pie -- somewhat standard fare of the day .
and there &apos;s about three hackerspaces or more in detroit .
these guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars , and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3d printers .
well , if i haven &apos;t convinced you that you &apos;re a maker , i hope i could convince you that our next generation should be makers , that kids are particularly interested in this , in this ability to control the physical world and be able to use things like micro-controllers and build robots .
and there &apos;s the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur .
there was a tremendous amount of technical achievement associated with creating this hollywood glamour .
it &apos;s a very glamorous portrait .
you can do a glamorized picture of an airplane , but not the inside .
the sense of , you know , life could be better , i could join this -- i could be a perfect person , i could join this perfect world .
and of course glass block has that sense of translucence .
&quot; the matrix &quot; is a movie that is all about glamour .
and that &apos;s to take isaac mizrahi &apos;s advice and confront the manipulation of it all , and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy , but also enjoy how it happens .
my body was often in the way .
i didn &apos;t have patience for my body ; i snapped it into shape .
but the more i talked about it , the more objectified and fragmented my body became .
it was as if i was living in a stagnant pool and cancer dynamited the boulder that was separating me from the larger sea .
and in the name of connectedness , she said , &quot; oh , it &apos;s the gulf of mexico . &quot;
it was underpaid and really loving nurses .
so as a teacher and as a spouse , this is , of course , a problem i confront every day .
they &apos;re mit undergraduates .
and then his went on the ground .
so that &apos;s why he &apos;s taking the other sandwich .
and so what we wanted to know was , could differences among adults in how they think about other people &apos;s thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region ?
and what i &apos;m going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they &apos;re making that judgment .
and in the case of the accident , where she thought that it was sugar , but it was really poison and so she caused a death , people say that it was less okay , she deserves more blame .
we changed their ability to judge other people &apos;s actions .
because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down , but they want to know how to slow down really quickly . so ...
and my wake-up call came when i started reading bedtime stories to my son , and i found that at the end of day , i would go into his room and i just couldn &apos;t slow down -- you know , i &apos;d be speed reading &quot; the cat in the hat . &quot;
it &apos;s always renewing and refreshing itself .
and in some ways , these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts , because i think when a slow city becomes officially a slow city , it &apos;s kind of like a philosophical declaration .
it &apos;s not just , though , these days , adults who overwork , though , is it ? it &apos;s children , too .
we fill our head with distraction , with busyness , so that we don &apos;t have to ask , am i well ? am i happy ? are my children growing up right ?
i no longer hear time &apos;s winged chariot drawing near , or at least not as much as i did before .
so , what i &apos;d like to talk about is something that was very dear to kahn &apos;s heart , which is : how do we discover what is really particular about a project ?
and out of this idea started spinning off many , many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities , and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits , and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry .
so , many years after that in 1998 , i was on one of my monthly trips to jerusalem and i got a call from the foreign ministry saying , &quot; we &apos;ve got the chief minister of the punjab here .
back to yad vashem three years ago . after all this episode began , yad vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum because now washington was built -- the holocaust museum in washington -- and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information .
the first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces -- spaces where research goes on , conference centers , a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking -- and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition , the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry .
through nature , the nature of the universe and the nature of man , we shall seek truth . if we seek truth , we shall find beauty . &quot;
so it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
it got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how i responded to it .
when you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds .
my name is kailash . and i like to enrich lives through technicolored glass .
and if our fates are intertwined , then we believe that it is good karma , it is good fortune .
this is a blue whale . we have blue whales in the waters around here , off maldives , around the waters of india . you can see them off kerala .
this is a very beautiful species , it &apos;s called the oriental scarlet .
if you &apos;re going to study dragonflies , you want to study those really bright beautiful ones , like that red one . or the really rare ones , the endemic endangered ones .
so , maldives , beautiful place .
and i got a bit curious about it .
far north of maldives , a bit later .
so , if you &apos;ve got india here , when the front is up above india you &apos;re into the southwest monsoon .
and we &apos;re starting in june . so this is the monsoon rain .
they &apos;ll hatch out in six weeks . by that time the seasonal rains have moved on . it &apos;s not there , it &apos;s down here .
there is more to the story .
they have the most incredible journey , but several make the crossing from india to africa . includes this one , the hobby .
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with my life .
the crazy thing was , there was a really liberating sense about it , because i no longer had to protect my record as a champion . &quot; champion , &quot; again .
it is the funnest trick ever to do .
but there &apos;s this other aspect of it for wheelies , so check this out . there &apos;s a few tricks , again , how environment changes the nature of your tricks .
next . these guys . very similar community that &apos;s extremely conducive to innovation .
and you get in a car , and you drive away , and 10-minute drive , and you get out , and no one gives a rat &apos;s who you are .
thank you .
now if you think about it , in the age before gps and radar , that was obviously a really difficult problem .
in fact , he would always get upset when people referred to the bombsight as his invention , because in his eyes , only god could invent things .
well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get shot down .
we live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really smart people running around , saying that they &apos;ve invented gadgets that will forever change our world .
what is the signature weapon of the cia &apos;s war in northwest pakistan ?
meanwhile , back in new york , no one told carl norden that his bombsight was used over hiroshima .
when did we originate as a species ?
these are three extinct species of hominids , potential human ancestors .
you and your siblings , you have a parent in common .
it doesn &apos;t happen very often . we have a proofreading mechanism built in .
this was an african man who gave rise to all the y chromosome diversity around the world .
the sea levels were dropping . and africa was turning to desert .
a slightly later migration up into the middle east .
it has three core components . obviously , science is a big part of it .
first , a video .
and where you have slightly more complex things , you can get slightly more complex things .
and energy does something else quite magical : it congeals to form matter -- quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons .
when very large stars die , they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations , to form all the elements of the periodic table .
you also need a great diversity of chemical elements , and you need liquid such as water .
the real beauty of dna though is in its imperfections .
the sad thing is , when they die , the information dies with them .
i hope you agree that this is a powerful story .
let &apos;s start with mortgages .
the average american household spends 1,000 dollars a year on lotteries .
and then they have to decide how they &apos;re going to invest in their 52 choices , and they never heard about what is a money market fund .
i predict scientifically 74 percent of you will go for bananas .
well , you still have choice .
one more before we flip the challenges into solutions , having to do with monkeys and apples .
if you think about the problem of bananas versus chocolates , we think we &apos;re going to eat bananas next week .
it &apos;s not just numbers on a piece of paper .
thank you .
all right .
what &apos;s your question , please ?
and the third said , &quot; let &apos;s find another director . &quot;
and as i go there , of course , my a.d. says , &quot; you know what you &apos;re going to do , sir . &quot; i say , &quot; of course i do . &quot;
and let &apos;s go to the universe because there &apos;s something out there that is more truthful than your mind , that is more truthful than your universe .
there was a woodcutter who &apos;s about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood , and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax .
now , a film .
and what they did was , they sent walter raleigh down to physically separate her mortal self from her spirit self .
elizabeth : tell me , is it true ?
you no longer have the queen &apos;s protection .
about ten years ago , i heard this little thing from a politician , not a politician that was very well respected in india .
and if there &apos;s any revolution , they cut off the water .
it is finite ; harmony is infinite .
so i was at a grateful dead benefit concert on the rainforests in 1988 .
and the people who made money from brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests .
now we &apos;re at 1.3 .
we &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
in every single case , the answer is &quot; it depends . &quot;
we looked at the threats to these places .
why is 25 percent important ?
they care about availability , so the big risk for them is not having product at all .
mars is also on a similar journey .
we can &apos;t just focus on identifying the best ; we &apos;ve got to move the rest .
but how to make it happen ?
it took many years , but eventually we developed an electrochemical neuroprosthesis that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state .
in fact , not only could the rat initiate and sustain locomotion on the ground , they could even adjust leg movement , for example , to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase .
this is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury , but i begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people &apos;s quality of life .
and although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant , with me standing here as the first lady of the united states of america , and you , just getting through school , i want you to know that we have very much in common .
they taught me about what a strong marriage feels like : that it &apos;s built on faith and commitment and an admiration for each other &apos;s unique gifts .
because communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong as the health of their women .
you too can pave the way .
michelle obama : a plea for education
when you &apos;re totally in the moment , when i &apos;m totally in the moment , the vessel of expression is open .
so i thought this morning i would try to be the optimist , and give reason to hope for the future of the internet by drawing upon its present .
instead , it &apos;s folks getting together to do something for fun , rather than because they were told to , or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it .
instead , again , it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater , but we can only see amidst the fog the people immediately around us .
and yet , somehow , within about two hours , the problem was fixed .
and then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project .
it does make you wonder if there were , for instance , a massive , extremely popular star trek convention one weekend , who would be minding the store ?
they start off on all sorts of goofy projects .
in fact , talk about technology imitating life imitating tech , or maybe it &apos;s the other way around .
it &apos;s not a noun . it &apos;s a verb .
we were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school , but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations .
but actually , if you look at how countries come out on this picture , you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity .
but even luxembourg can spend its money only once , and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well .
people have taken up the challenge , done something about it .
those things really exist .
they set very ambitious standards , but then they enable their teachers to figure out , what do i need to teach to my students today ?
you just can &apos;t rely on the people out there to help you with this .
and in the end , there &apos;s better bargaining between the authorities and citizens , and democracies , capitalism -- everything else flourished .
and my family moved out of an urban place , where we used to live , to a remote rural area where it was safer .
the question was , how much did it cost to install a new telephone in bangladesh ?
so if the telephone is a production tool , then we don &apos;t quite have to worry about the purchasing power .
she typically buys a cow . the cow gives milk .
and two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day , which is like 700 dollars per year .
and this is a new project i have with dean kamen , the famous inventor in america .
and i realized that perhaps the western world will not continue to dominate the world forever .
and that meant that foreigners , as it said in the treaty , were allowed to trade freely in china .
but really , really natural sovereignty was good for japan .
health services were provided .
but on the other hand , guizhou , one of the poorest inland provinces of china , is there .
we have an enormous disparity in the world .
we add japan to it .
and i expect to speak in the first session of the 39th ted india .
so we have these stars going around in circles like this .
i &apos;m just putting this big , blue blob on there , ok , to try to remind you that it &apos;s there .
yes ! the rays would lie on a -- i &apos;d like to see -- yeah , on a cone .
ok , so the question is : do we see this in the sky ?
they &apos;re not necessarily moving through space .
dark matter , because it gravitationally attracts , it tends to encourage the growth of structure , ok .
it is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the large hadron collider .
so it started when jonny was little , and he first started the banjo , he would play on his back with his eyes closed , and we &apos;d say it looked like he was sleeping .
so you can imagine the scale of this problem .
you load it up in the normal way . this is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license .
but i &apos;m going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem that &apos;s more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology .
so if you &apos;re a software engineer and you &apos;re trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program , it &apos;s important to think about how much it costs .
this is not just through malaria .
you get on google , you google , and you find , actually the only people tested in burkina faso in 1991 are std patients and pregnant women , which is not a terribly representative group of people .
so this is a graph of prevalence estimated by unaids , and prevalence based on the mortality data for the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in africa .
and that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the us .
so you can see that both of these series -- the black line is export value , the red line is new hiv infections -- you can see they &apos;re both increasing .
if i could reveal anything that is hidden from us , at least in modern cultures , it would be to reveal something that we &apos;ve forgotten , that we used to know as well as we knew our own names .
but it was fascinating to me , because i was looking at this sort of fine italian end papers .
they &apos;re the people who make the bullet train .
this is a little critter that &apos;s in the namibian desert .
it &apos;s extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years .
in our world we use about 350 polymers to make all this .
here &apos;s a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale .
and we &apos;re working with eol , encyclopedia of life , ed wilson &apos;s ted wish .
and many scientists believe it &apos;s the most serious issue facing mankind .
thank you .
i don &apos;t know if he really meant &#91; that &#93; , but it happened .
i joined the indian police service as a tough woman , a woman with indefatigable stamina , because i used to run for my tennis titles , etc .
normally police officers don &apos;t want to do prison .
this was initiated in delhi prison .
and write to me on kiranbedi.com , and i &apos;ll respond to you .
kiran bedi : a police chief with a difference
so let me tell you what this project started .
so you start with a book , and then you scan it .
and in fact , the number of sites that are using recaptcha is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re digitizing per day is really , really large .
some of them are very cute .
so i posed this question to him : how can we get 100 million people translating the web into every major language for free ?
so the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question .
that &apos;s a big problem .
people really can learn a language with it .
so here &apos;s the thing : the current business model for language education is the student pays , and in particular , the student pays rosetta stone 500 dollars .
now , a decade later , it &apos;s really time to push the envelope a little bit , and so a couple years ago i moved to paris with my husband and youngest child , and we launched buzzcar a year ago .
i met these founders just weeks after they had launched , and now , in two years , what would you do for five dollars ?
hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative , they &apos;d never thought of it before .
cool guys , excited guys , and here is selma , who -- i love this driver .
a decade ago , robin chase founded zipcar in the us , now the largest car-sharing company in the world . now she &apos;s exploring the next level of car-sharing : buzzcar , a french startup that lets people rent their own cars to others . the details are fascinating , and the larger vision points to a new definition of ownership and entrepreneurship .
as human beings , we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present .
if mind-wandering were a slot machine , it would be like having the chance to lose 50 dollars , 20 dollars or one dollar . right ? you &apos;d never want to play .
i was free , i was happy .
and there , i started by searching for the footprints in my childhood .
the heat was on .
ghana found itself in the same place in which the u.s. election stalled in the 2000 presidential elections -- bush versus gore .
and i started living down there on the beach for a long time .
but what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there , and see what would happen inside there .
it &apos;s two fans , one which he could turn from outside after he got the vacuum established , and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it , the one fan would no longer turn the other one , right ?
candles can &apos;t burn in a vacuum , therefore , probably sparklers wouldn &apos;t either .
in fact , everybody in this room probably , especially if you picked up your bag -- some of you , i know , didn &apos;t pick up your bags -- but if you picked up your bag , everybody in this room has got in their pocket , or back in their room , something that 350 years ago , kings would have gone to war to have .
you know , that &apos;s what you call a lead .
and i said , there is a way to get a frog up to where he wants to go .
but if you go to authority , and you always don &apos;t -- you don &apos;t always get the right answer , see .
they were the same people that later went in to medical school , you know , because there was money in it , you know . i mean , later , then they all got into business -- i mean , there are waves of -- going into your high school , person saying , you want to be rich , you know , be a scientist . you know , not anymore .
but in fact , it was just coming up -- it was the nighttime ; the daytime temperatures didn &apos;t go up .
if they -- if they -- if they actually -- if they actually said that , i &apos;m getting out .
most people ignore them or are frightened of them .
i would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if i went back in time and became a child again .
it must have been a very unusual day for him .
the first tunnels date back to 60 b.c .
i &apos;ve become more interested in capturing movement and texture .
and would you be able to , kind of , draw a -- you don &apos;t have to draw the diagram , but would you be able to draw the diagram , if you had to do it ? or would you just say , that &apos;s actually not possible ?
and so , there &apos;s a whole lot of people saying , &quot; i &apos;d be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air .
it makes no odds . in fact , in the northern hemisphere , we &apos;re further from the sun in summer , as it happens , but it makes no odds , the difference .
and i know that if the graduates at mit and in the imperial college in london had had the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff , and you know , been able to do it , they would have learned how it actually works , rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can &apos;t do it .
ah ha , right . second question is , why is the sea blue ? all right ?
and evolution , although it was established well over 100 years ago by charles darwin and a vast number of other people , evolution still is a little bit intangible .
and as i pause for a few seconds , have a look at the screen .
so we have to think differently if we &apos;re going to make stuff come alive .
so when you think about the improbable nature of what i &apos;m going to tell you in the next few minutes , just remember , we came from stuff on planet earth .
and they had a look at what was in the soup , and they found amino acids , but nothing came out , there was no cell .
and so with this lego kit , we have the diversity required for complex information storage without dna .
we want to put it out in the environment , and we want it to be powered by the sun .
we really struggle to do this .
and the reason i really like these goals is that there are eight of them .
no -- low-income countries like kenya still don &apos;t have that level of organization .
but in june , i got a mail in my inbox from demographic health surveys , and it showed good news from kenya .
there was resistance for the old malaria drugs , until we got the new drugs .
and what has happened over the years since then ? here we go .
but look , the rate of lowering in sweden was not fast .
now , let me now bring you to a wider picture , a wider picture of child mortality .
there we are today .
that is , when we get girls in school , we &apos;ll get an impact 15 to 20 years later , which is a secular trend which is very strong .
well , poor do not remain poor ; they become lower-middle-class .
and it was that compassion which bothered them , because when he saw -- in fact , he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car -- he drives his own car by the way -- and he saw in the rain , a family like the one that i showed to you getting drenched with an infant .
the team leader was girish wagh , a 34 year-old boy in &#91; unclear &#93; .
and what happened was that -- more from less -- you can see how much more for how much less .
and of course , these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads .
... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ... ) one kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds .
for example , we don &apos;t want 20,000 dollars ; we don &apos;t have it .
so the message he was giving us was you must get more from less and less and less so that you can share it for more and more people , not only the current generation , but the future generations .
and infants die .
ram : i &apos;ll tell you a story that drove me , that transformed my life .
they divide them farther .
first of all , i &apos;ve been programming in multiple other programming languages to get the basics down , such as python , c , java , etc .
well , i have a big announcement to make today , and i &apos;m really excited about this .
and this is buried below ground , which is really important .
so for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor , a lot more of it &apos;s being used .
you can put them anywhere in the world you want to .
but i think there &apos;s something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars , because the stars are giant fusion reactors .
then you can &apos;t help but make them go &quot; wow &quot; ; you can &apos;t help but turn it into a memorable event -- you can &apos;t help but turn it into an experience .
now , there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience , but even that is a matter of degree , not kind .
so , how do you render authenticity , is the question .
you can think about those two -- you know , both of these better than being fake fake -- not quite as good as being real real .
right , the t &amp; amp ; a network . then it bought miramax , known for its nc-17 fare , and all of a sudden , families everywhere couldn &apos;t really trust what they were getting from disney .
let me summarize it , for the business people in the audience , with three rules , three basic rules .
when i was in high school , i loved to program computers , so i sort of liked the logical flow of events .
and because the wishbone is bone -- it &apos;s animal -- it &apos;s sort of a point where i think we can enter into it .
and it &apos;s really , just sort of -- for me , it was just really about the lusciousness of oil .
it would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner .
sculptor and engineer arthur ganson talks about his work -- kinetic art that explores deep philosophical ideas and is gee-whiz fun to look at .
51 days 52 days : developing retina , nose and fingers the fetus &apos; continual movement in the womb is necessary for muscular and skeletal growth .
the complexity of building that within a single system is , again , beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today .
i spent about eight months working on these profiles .
and if you have a liquid hot mass , it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum .
it &apos;s a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae .
so this is a mystery .
coming back to the most important question , &quot; is there anybody out there ? &quot;
you can see the spectrum of the earth , this earthshine spectrum , and that is a very clear signal .
i think it will not come from ufos .
i tried to call deep on my courage .
i want to understand them .
and so i thought , this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick .
these are whole-hearted people , living from this deep sense of worthiness .
this led to a little breakdown -- -- which actually looked more like this .
and i think i have a problem , and i need some help . &quot;
we numb vulnerability -- when we &apos;re waiting for the call .
and it becomes this dangerous cycle .
and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand , our job is not to say , &quot; look at her , she &apos;s perfect .
i got up this morning at 6 : 10 a.m .
i just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor .
the self is just our operation center , our consciousness , our moral compass .
all of our statuses are different .
so , this is what it looks like when you go to the website .
and here is data on 15,000 people &apos;s current anxiety , right now .
i can look at my constipation , how to manage it .
you &apos;ve seen multiple of these today , when everyone &apos;s bragging about the amazing things they &apos;ve done .
it &apos;s never going to work . you can &apos;t do it . &quot;
these are all the patients that started lithium .
we hired them , set them up , assisting at lab .
why can &apos;t we solve these problems ?
a tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun .
i &apos;m going to show to tedsters , the first time , this operating .
if you do this , you get the last puzzle piece , which is water .
this is why we have to solve our problems , and i know the answer as to how is to be able to get exquisite control over a building block of nature , the stuff of life : the simple electron .
so you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics .
where are economic networks ?
scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data , because a foundational guideline in science is : let the data speak . okay . let &apos;s do that .
this is very much in the sense of max weber &apos;s idea of potential power , which is the probability of imposing one &apos;s own will despite the opposition of others .
we &apos;re seeing the emergence of long-term and highly-funded programs which aim at understanding our networked world from a complexity point of view .
in infrastructure , let &apos;s just take one example .
so we can study this as a physical , intuitive model .
but most importantly , we can use this same software for the design of nanoscale self-assembly systems and human scale self-assembly systems .
this is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own .
did you see how you landed ?
but if i &apos;m interested in potential , if i &apos;m interested in your potential , or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity , what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re creating the cult of the average with science .
see what we &apos;re finding is it &apos;s not necessarily the reality that shapes us , but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality .
75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels , your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat .
and if happiness is on the opposite side of success , your brain never gets there .
and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies , what we &apos;ve found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success , and in doing so , not only create ripples of positivity , but create a real revolution .
like back here , there &apos;s like , concrete block technology here , and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu , because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing , and so you have to have heavy stuff to push out the liquid and make it hard .
it &apos;s a little slim volume ; i &apos;m not sure if you &apos;ve seen this .
so i could , sort of , change the kind of stability with a little control there on the dial , and i can sort of watch it flip around .
it became computerish ; we began to think computerish -- the x , y system -- and so that was kind of a revelation .
and also , one thing i realized is that i like to make things .
the computer lives in so many dimensions .
and so computers , as you know , these big computers , there are now tiny computers .
i discovered that i had to find the equation of art and design , which we know as circle-triangle-square .
and i have no idea what risd should be , actually , or what it wants to be , but one thing i have to tell you is that although i &apos;m a technologist , i don &apos;t like technology very much .
for every 100 girls who are expelled from school , there are 335 boys who are expelled from school .
there are three reasons that i believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today .
and the answer is no , he &apos;s just a boy .
by the time you &apos;re in first grade , you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture , maybe not , in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages .
they &apos;re glorified drill and practice .
they &apos;re nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to lead us .
bubbles of vapor form inside the water , then they expand , turning liquid into gas .
but the reason why i am interested in the transition of the higgs field is because i want to address the question , why is the higgs boson mass so special ?
but whichever it turns out to be , there is one thing i &apos;m sure of : the journey will be full of surprises .
and they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work .
it was about five meters long , and i covered myself and the floor with ink and made a massive mess , but i learned to print .
and we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better .
so i &apos;ve made some new technology , and i love things being creative , and i love working with creative people .
you know , just like people on the street when you get too close to them .
from my current self , i &apos;m turned into a middle-aged man , and then , from there , into an elderly man .
the picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time .
you just push a few buttons in the cockpit , and the wings come out .
while nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports , there is a huge underutilized resource out there .
if you think about it , if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods , you basically have two choices .
it actually works by giving you the impression that you &apos;ve had a very good education , which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted self-confidence , which then makes you very , very successful in later life .
now , boring people would have just simply banned the veil .
here &apos;s one : &quot; gold gab ich für eisen , 1813 . &quot;
and on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it .
i &apos;ll give you one example .
so they are introducing new diamond shreddies .
there is some evidence , by the way , that things like social networking help do that .
i was so excited . &quot; yes , i did it ! i became a hero .
now that , i suggest , is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously .
if , if , if , then .
he talked mostly about animals and plants , but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct .
but a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition .
and i &apos;m glad to say , as i expected , i found it when i came here , and i &apos;m sure all of you found it , too .
it always comes back , as richard dawkins complained all that long time ago , it always comes back to genes .
let &apos;s call them techno-memes or temes .
so , i would suggest that we don &apos;t think intelligence , we think replicators .
you know all about big brains .
that &apos;s how it seems to us .
maybe we will , maybe we won &apos;t .
and after the quake , we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed , to examine what was safe and what wasn &apos;t .
on his last job he was working with his boss , and they started pouring the columns wrong .
and if you spend a lot of time in hospital , you &apos;ll see a lot of types of irrationalities .
or , if you had to choose between the last two , which one would you choose ?
i would pass their sheet of paper .
so we said , &quot; if people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations , to these forces , what could be going on ? &quot;
as you can expect it doesn &apos;t last very long ; people take it .
the same thing happens .
if somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating , we feel it &apos;s more appropriate , as a group , to behave this way .
so i went back to talk to them and tell them what i found out about removing bandages .
it &apos;s actually bitcoin .
there &apos;s a p.r. company called edelman , they do this very interesting survey every year precisely around trust and what people are thinking .
it could become a natural extension , that as well as buying stuff -- take it out of the kindle -- you could buy books , music , real-life products , appliances and goods and so on .
were saying that they &apos;re comfortable using an independent or branded currency .
and what i do is i look for similarities and differences in the solutions that they &apos;ve evolved for fundamental biological problems .
most of the time it &apos;s a flexible organ .
it has to be part of the explanation .
and i thought , &quot; yeah , he does have a really good point here . &quot;
it &apos;s an observation with obvious medical applications in humans as well , but it &apos;s also relevant in a broad sense , i think , to the design of prosthetics , soft robots , basically anything where changes of shape and stiffness are important .
i &apos;ve recorded lots of cds .
then — will i keep going ?
nm : well , um ...
will we play a tune ?
so one thing that i took from home is this notion that educators don &apos;t necessarily have to teach .
and in short order , thousands of people were building our machine .
we are obsessed with grades because we are obsessed with data , and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing , and a huge part of education is about failing .
and all this is something that a very young child can pick up using such mobile apps .
can you imagine your world without it ?
we only know so much about the situation in the congo and in the mines because of the kind of communication the mobile phone allows .
i missed my family and the friends i left behind .
and it &apos;s not just caterers , it &apos;s hoteliers , it &apos;s retailers , it &apos;s anyone who provides services to the public or businesses .
because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get .
in the early days of this modern markets technology , the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power , their back office processes , their relationships , their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity .
and it puts some obligations on those operators .
and there would be no constraints on alternative markets .
plenty of people need jobs with very flexible hours -- but it &apos;s difficult for those people to connect with the employers who need them . wingham rowan is working on that . he explains how the same technology that powers modern financial markets can help employers book workers for slivers of time .
so i quit my job and decided that that &apos;s the subject that i wanted to tackle .
if you look 50 years into the future , the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three , with some wind , with some other things , but these are going to be the base load energy drivers .
and there is one reaction that &apos;s probably the easiest fusion reaction to do .
and the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate .
when people say fusion is 30 years away , and always will be , i say , &quot; yeah , but we &apos;ve actually done it . &quot; right ?
but this is what we &apos;re aiming at , sometime in the 2030s -- real electric power from fusion . thank you very much .
but under the surface was a very different reality .
if , however , the core issues that propelled the revolution aren &apos;t addressed , the consequences could be catastrophic -- not just for egypt , but for the entire region .
now why this matters is because we discovered a link between people &apos;s faith in their democratic process and their faith that oppressed people can change their situation through peaceful means alone .
the answer is no .
and this isn &apos;t some suburban iphone-using teen phenomenon .
no one hears you in a stall , you &apos;re just texting quietly .
what &apos;s going on in your school ? &quot;
clemenceau said , &quot; life gets interesting when we fail , because it &apos;s a sign that we &apos;ve surpassed ourselves . &quot;
we are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it .
it can fly up , down , forwards , backwards , even upside-down .
the result , a four-by-four-inch artificial nano-gecko adhesive .
it was made in tobacco plants .
they remind us that we all have nerd power .
he was encouraging , but firm .
now the purpose of the vehicle though , the purpose of the technology , is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes .
i mean , do you worry about the pandora &apos;s box issue here ?
a few years ago , my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry .
now , recently i &apos;ve been told i &apos;ve been taking the high road .
and the warden was quite amused , and he told me he thought that i was a nut and he told me , &quot; this place is a correction facility . these guys are serious offenders .
i &apos;ve had it . &quot;
and so this kid was probably abused , abandoned , ignored , betrayed by almost every adult along the way .
that &apos;s what perspective is all about .
that &apos;s where joshua descended and crossed the jordan and led the people of israel into the land of canaan 3,000 years ago in this final leg of the journey from africa .
what is real is separateness , and at some point in early babyhood , the idea of self starts to form .
and it is important .
i applied to read anthropology at university .
we &apos;d be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing .
i &apos;ve become very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior .
hello , my name is thomas heatherwick .
and so you &apos;re stuck on a bus .
so that &apos;s it speeded up .
it has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top .
but you just have to go to a garden center , and they &apos;re in little paper packets .
and with a million people there a day , it just felt like offering some public space .
so there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city .
thank you , thomas .
and as you can see , large amounts of the brain are not purple , showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region , so does his fraternal twin .
for example , there &apos;s excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense , and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history .
let me start with the arts .
they didn &apos;t ask me , but by their own admission , they need all the help that they can get .
well , the other hot button is parenting .
i think that the sciences of human nature -- behavioral genetics , evolutionary psychology , neuroscience , cognitive science -- are going to , increasingly in the years to come , upset various dogmas , careers and deeply-held political belief systems .
and they said , &quot; the band is applied to the tail , tightly .
and he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
he says , &quot; ok . &quot;
&quot; push it further . &quot;
and i &apos;m up to my neck in anagnorises every single day .
i can still see hillary doing the shots of rye , dribbling down her chin , with the steel workers .
he &apos;s making a great living .
most hazardous environment i &apos;d ever seen , and i was back with a guy , lashing the pots down .
and we &apos;ve waged this war on at least four fronts , certainly in hollywood .
our tools today don &apos;t look like shovels and picks .
and then it got bigger and bigger and bigger , and now it &apos;s 886 pages long .
now broadmoor is broadmoor hospital .
and he wasn &apos;t wearing sweatpants , he was wearing a pinstriped suit .
he said , &quot; well , if i &apos;d just done my time in prison for the original crime , i &apos;d have got five years .
and in fact , faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath .
who cares ? that &apos;s not a big story .
he &apos;d close down 30 percent of the workforce .
he said he got accepted into west point , and they don &apos;t let delinquents in west point .
he said , &quot; i &apos;ve got a tribunal coming up .
because you shouldn &apos;t define people by their maddest edges .
now , the reason i begin by saying &quot; no 9 / 11 , no war &quot; is that we have to acknowledge that islam , as interpreted by a very , very small , extremely radical group of people , was a precipitating cause of the 9 / 11 attacks -- the precipitating cause of the 9 / 11 attacks -- and as a consequence , at one degree of remove , the precipitating cause of the coming war that we &apos;re about to be engaged in .
you know , post-9 / 11 , we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of george w. bush saying , &quot; islam means peace . &quot;
that &apos;s an academic question .
what does it mean to say that there &apos;s an islamic democracy ?
noah feldman makes a searing case that both politics and religion -- whatever their differences -- are similar technologies , designed to efficiently connect and manage any group of people .
we have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing , but completely inexperienced , volunteers .
but what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers -- three of whom here are force-feeding penguins .
and it would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin .
personally , i learned that i am capable of handling so much more than i ever dreamed possible .
we &apos;ve got edible canal towpaths , and we &apos;ve got sprouting cemeteries .
so , back to the public meeting .
so we got some land that was donated by a local garden center .
whichever way they want to do it , of their own volition , they &apos;re trying to make their own lives differently , and worldwide , we &apos;ve got communities across america and japan -- it &apos;s incredible , isn &apos;t it ? i mean , america and japan and new zealand .
and i &apos;m intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today .
indeed , some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy .
the great rabbi meir said that any interpretation of scripture which led to hatred and disdain , or contempt of other people -- any people whatsoever -- was illegitimate .
since september the 11th , when my work on islam suddenly propelled me into public life , in a way that i &apos;d never imagined , i &apos;ve been able to sort of go all over the world , and finding , everywhere i go , a yearning for change .
and priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons , and he , too , starts to weep . and the sound of their weeping filled the house .
and that can be seen directly through a microscope , and i &apos;m going to show you some of this today .
so this whole world , the nano world , this area in here is called the nano world , and the nano world , the whole micro world that we see , there &apos;s a nano world that is wrapped up within that , and the whole -- and that is the world of molecules and atoms .
and the reason that is , is because in a place like this island , a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow , and when they die , their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand , things like coral and so forth .
and i started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes .
so , 120 years ago , dr. röntgen x-rayed his wife &apos;s hand .
but i think the process , in itself , shows how exquisite they are .
an amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional .
and i sent them back an x-ray .
to get the detail in a feather , believe me , if there is anyone out here who knows anything about x-rays , that &apos;s quite a challenge .
because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves .
and what &apos;s good about this , i think , is that it &apos;s like a moment in time , like you &apos;ve turned around , you &apos;ve got x-ray vision and you &apos;ve taken a picture with the x-ray camera .
i &apos;d like to apologize , first of all , to all of you because i have no form of powerpoint presentation .
this is a wonderful thing .
and when we die , we don &apos;t even have to be placed in different refuse sacs .
but we don &apos;t notice that bit ; we just unconditionally love .
if you go to the safari parks on saturn or jupiter , you will be disappointed .
just flash it , scare the guy . he &apos;s a punk .
our enemy is thoughtlessness . this is philosophy . &quot;
thank you .
everything was okay , until i got to about the age of 26 , and i went to a movie called &quot; short circuit . &quot;
and everything i saw in the cultivation said there were huge fights amongst the foodies between the cultivators and the hunter-gatherers .
in fact , when i saw &quot; supersize me , &quot; i starting thinking of saying , what would happen if an individual had 31 days nonstop fox news ?
now get this : until recently , he was earning an official monthly salary of less than 7,000 dollars .
so let &apos;s go back to some of those people i talked about earlier .
and then there &apos;s the problem of anonymous shell companies .
and now forgive me , i &apos;m going to read the next bit because it &apos;s a very live issue , and our lawyers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right .
in a globalized world , corruption is a truly globalized business , and one that needs global solutions , supported and pushed by us all , as global citizens , right here .
you become a christian , muslim , jew .
it gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what &apos;s inside them .
and through their work over the last years , this is not only happening that this house is opening , but it &apos;s being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it .
in the years that she walked , she educated parents , mothers , fathers .
we come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time , moving towards a new place .
but the main reason i did it is that that &apos;s what happens to me when i &apos;m forced to wear a lady gaga skanky mic .
they all need a face .
i had no idea what i was doing , i had no idea where i was going , but at some point , i stopped -- when to keep going would seem like i was going too far .
and the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image , and he wanted to explore what was underlying that .
a book cover is a distillation .
then he &apos;d run his hand over the rag paper , and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages .
what does it look like ?
on the other hand , we kids still dream about perfection .
okay , so they didn &apos;t tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that , but my dad did read to us about aristotle and pioneer germ fighters when lots of other kids were hearing &quot; the wheels on the bus go round and round . &quot;
now , the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas .
when i began recording in the late &apos; 60s , the typical methods of recording were limited to the fragmented capture of individual species like birds mostly , in the beginning , but later animals like mammals and amphibians .
but here &apos;s a picture of lincoln meadow taken after , and you can see that from the perspective of the camera or the human eye , hardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place , which would confirm the logging company &apos;s contention that there &apos;s nothing of environmental impact .
horrified , my colleagues remained behind to gather his thoughts and to record whatever he could the rest of the afternoon , and that evening , he captured a remarkable event : the lone surviving male beaver swimming in slow circles crying out inconsolably for its lost mate and offspring .
the school i went to was pretty boring .
to play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing &quot; battlestar galactica . &quot;
it grows every year .
and what &apos;s interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves .
throughout human history people have played games .
mr. rogers , walt disney , nick junior , and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly left their mark on me .
it lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional .
to some degree i &apos;ve learned how to drive from the game .
but as you heard , michael talked about all these other elements as well .
this is my daughter , her name &apos;s emma , she &apos;s 17 months old .
and our friend , betty edwards , the &quot; drawing on the right side of the brain &quot; lady , shows these two tables to her drawing class and says , &quot; the problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can &apos;t move your hand , but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty .
if we do more in a kind of a stupid way , the simplicity gets complex and , in fact , we can keep on doing it for a very long time .
so they pick a shape they like -- like a diamond , or a square , or a triangle , or a trapezoid -- and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape , and the next larger shape .
each time i click it , car turn .
teacher : &#91; choose &#93; objects that you think will fall to the earth at the same time .
and i thought i would do just one thing on the $ 100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here .
and yet , i don &apos;t really think it is because when it comes down to it , it &apos;s this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain -- what people in the future are going to remember about this period .
we &apos;re reading the book of life .
it &apos;s changing our lives in so many ways , and it will continue to do that .
we &apos;re all identical to each other . isn &apos;t it wonderful ? &quot;
the first is cloning .
humanity is going to go down this path .
this is the flowering of human endeavor . &quot;
you know it &apos;s a little bit like a birth .
&quot; the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them , both glory and danger alike .
and i said , &quot; well , funny you should ask .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
so i go , &quot; you know , why don &apos;t we go on the internet , and maybe we can see ... like on wikipedia . &quot;
the thought of the surgery was not attractive .
it then comes back into a round form and then tapers and curves off .
and in fact , if you speak to people who are on long-term warfarin , it is a serious compromise to your quality of life .
and then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta .
a big problem with understanding one of those perspectives : when we first approached one of the big u.k. charitable organizations that funds this kind of stuff , what they were looking at was essentially an engineering proposal .
egos , of course , again , a huge problem if you &apos;re working in a multidisciplinary team , you &apos;ve got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it -- newspapers ?
the third world is connected , we are connected .
tech guru , like this man -- that a german magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century -- they are shaping the way we do things .
now you see me thinking at my kitchen table , and since you &apos;re in my kitchen , please meet my wife .
he said , &quot; i can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life . &quot;
in lebanon , it was not a book .
and so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation .
right after , i got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention , and with all great earnestness walked in .
we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now , till we hit the second microbial age .
and that &apos;s what happens in an asteroid catastrophe , because that &apos;s what this was , of course . this is the famous k-t .
these are mammal-like reptiles .
warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time .
it &apos;s because lipids are so tough , they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary , and be extracted and tell us who was there .
they stop complex life from existing .
so , he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours , sometimes six hours , and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here .
how many of you have exceeded it ? yeah , i &apos;ve certainly exceeded it .
children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations .
you &apos;ve seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world , even in developed countries .
so at a national level -- and we work in about 60 different countries -- at a national level we &apos;ve got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil .
everybody else at the table said , &quot; folks , that doesn &apos;t cut it .
the problem is the lack of trust , the lack of confidence , the lack of partnership between ngos , campaign groups , civil society organizations and multinational companies .
the private actors , companies and ngos , are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face .
and human rights comes down to a very simple proposition : can i give this person their dignity back ?
&quot; and , baby , &quot; i &apos;ll tell her , don &apos;t keep your nose up in the air like that .
and when they finally hand you heartache , when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on street-corners of cynicism and defeat , you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother .
i felt that my two secret loves , poetry and theatre , had come together , had a baby , a baby i needed to get to know .
it &apos;s not just the adage &quot; write what you know . &quot;
charlotte was very good at writing lists , but she refused to write any poems .
plus , spoken word poetry allows for immediate connections .
i think that we all did .
the only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light .
our political and military leaders were telling us one thing , and photographers were telling us another .
i &apos;d like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events and issues i &apos;ve been involved in over the past 25 years .
one of the things i had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger .
the next day i left for rwanda , and it was like taking the express elevator to hell .
an aluminum factory in czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust , and four out of five workers came down with cancer .
in the fall of 2004 i went to darfur .
for the first time in years , shi &apos;ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to karbala to observe ashura , and i was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion .
we cherish the opportunity to have our say , to help decide the future of the country .
how do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret ?
instead , we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves .
will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century ?
this is in 1960 .
we get that from the census data .
i take them backwards here to their independence , when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s .
this is a country that indeed has gone through a very , very interesting modernization .
then there is one billion between 30 and 45 , almost one between 45 and 60 .
so when you discuss and when you plan for the resources and the energy needed for the future , for human beings on this planet , you have to plan for 10 billion .
and then , like everyone else in our generation , we went to live in a himalayan monastery .
day seven , they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication .
you could vaccinate everybody in india , but one year later there &apos;ll be 21 million new babies , which was then the population of canada .
i feel like hank aaron . barry bonds can replace me any time .
we are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage , with just a little bit of human-to-human transmission , but no human-to-human-to-human sustained transmission .
but the joke is , an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve .
instead of a novel virus caused by bio-terror or bio-error , or shift or drift , we find it , and we contain it .
that &apos;s how the world found out about sars .
it &apos;s fantastic for them and their families , but we &apos;ve got two billion people in the global middle class today , and this swells that number to five , a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity .
that the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day-to-day issues , the day-to-day issues of , how do i get my kids to school ?
you &apos;ll change your smartphone seven or eight times , probably more if you &apos;re in this audience .
people sometimes think that 100 percent &apos;s going to be hard , and we &apos;ve had the conversation in the business .
but think of a solar panel .
so let &apos;s take an example , measure the things that are important in your business .
this room may appear to be holding 600 people , but there &apos;s actually so many more , because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities .
she &apos;s concerned about what &apos;s happening in this world right now .
and i realize we &apos;re all busy people , so don &apos;t worry , you can do this on a lunch break .
i think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere .
elizabeth lesser : take &quot; the other &quot; to lunch
his real name is joshua , and he &apos;s pictured here in a cell where he once used to torture and murder people , including children .
i was intensely moved during all this .
in 2007 and 2009 i did stories on the delhi fire service , the dfs , which , during the summer , is probably the world &apos;s most active fire department .
over the years , my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested .
so you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
so , i mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two reuters employees ?
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
the material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot;
and you were also -- i mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
it was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
i find weather extremely fascinating .
so all the way around , you have a 24-hour timeline .
lauren hodge : if you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option , which would you choose , grilled or fried chicken ?
most of the others either never responded back , said they didn &apos;t have the time or didn &apos;t have the equipment and couldn &apos;t help me .
and i want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant .
but here &apos;s the problem : sometimes patients become resistant to the drug , and then years after they &apos;ve been declared to be cancer free , they come back .
it was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing .
i &apos;m going to show it to you on my laptop .
and that saying is that genetics loads the gun , but the environment pulls the trigger .
and immediately a voice shouted , &quot; kangaroo ! &quot;
curious encounters were happening to me at the time ; i &apos;d been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world .
and even at this point , i started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness as the only aesthetic ideal .
it is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency .
so &#91; as &#93; susan boyle was saying that , 80,000 live audience sang together .
so i was on a national television prime-time show .
but anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
so making a living is not that easy for young people .
so any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest .
but of course , we do have young people who would still prefer to smile , whether in a bmw or &#91; on &#93; a bicycle .
and it made me want to explore more .
but technology alone isn &apos;t enough .
we filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower and using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times .
karen bass : unseen footage , untamed nature
never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized , never before as concentrated .
the people will revolt , they predicted , because the very best music was no longer available , because they had shifted to the second best public domain provided by bmi .
i want to share all my love with you ...
and on the other side , among our kids , there &apos;s a growing copyright abolitionism , a generation that rejects the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do , rejects copyright and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible .
we can only drive it underground .
and then he went and knocked an old lady house .
they use it to get to the truth , and they do what mature leaders do everyday ; they have difficult conversations with difficult people , sometimes during very difficult times .
and you can &apos;t find this guy on google ; you can &apos;t find him anywhere .
we &apos;re deeply ambivalent about the truth .
nine-year-olds , masters of the cover up .
we also heard distancing language : &quot; that woman . &quot;
don &apos;t overdo the botox ; nobody will think you &apos;re honest .
we &apos;re going to see him talk about getting a paternity test .
they &apos;ll alter their vocal tone , often making their vocal tone much lower .
and that -- maybe it &apos;ll fade too with time -- but i don &apos;t think so .
when you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking , listening , you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie .
there &apos;s been a lot of talk about narrative in africa .
the first igbo bible was translated from english in about the 1800s by bishop crowther , who was a yoruba .
so there &apos;s tom , dick and harry and they &apos;re working construction .
and they were to blow up strategic targets and take over the country , and they were foiled by a nigerian james bond called coyote williams , and a jewish nazi hunter .
shut him up . &quot;
it wasn &apos;t until later , when i was imprisoned again , that i understood the real meaning of torture , and how easy your humanity can be taken from you , for the time i was engaged in war , righteous , righteous war .
it &apos;s called &quot; ode to the drum , &quot; and i &apos;ll try and read it the way yusef would be proud to hear it read .
they want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful , to be healthy , and to have a successful life .
so let &apos;s start with the data .
and they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs , giving them small loans .
ultimately , coke &apos;s success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a coca-cola .
it doesn &apos;t sound anything like &quot; wavin &apos; flag &quot; to me .
and can you guess what the young men are waiting for ?
it could have come from nepal , just to the north , across the border , or from jharkhand , a state just to the south .
to me , that is deep happiness .
we did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
the top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like kingman reef , which is now protected .
so if we have to reset the baseline , if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left , how can we do it ?
they reproduce . that &apos;s population biology 101 .
this is grouper sex , and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of december and january for a week .
so how can we do that ?
there has been a lot of competition in the past , and we need to develop a new model of partnership , truly collaborative , where we are looking for complementing , not substituting .
it would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well .
we &apos;ve got some of the most incredible video of titanic that &apos;s ever been seen , and we &apos;re not going to show you any of it .
i love that kind of stuff .
this is really a world within a world , and we &apos;re going to show you two .
one of the things we &apos;re trying to do at woods hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world -- this world , this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory .
and you can see how dense the population is .
and they disintegrate on the way up , so the imagery is critical for the science .
it &apos;s how they find the hydrothermal vents .
although the vent sites are short-lived -- an individual site may last only 10 years or so -- as an ecosystem they &apos;ve been stable for millions -- well , billions -- of years .
what we &apos;re learning now , it &apos;s almost like a symphony .
this is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
and then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
how long will it take you to fill it up ? and that &apos;s it .
we &apos;re no longer averse to word problems , because we &apos;ve redefined what a word problem is .
because the small hadron collider once was the big thing .
this is where you &apos;ll find the fastest growing young populations of the world .
that &apos;s where maureen went to school .
this is the best you can get in hyderabad in indian education .
and so education needs to work by pull , not push .
and what you find when you go to these schemes is that they use people and places in incredibly creative ways .
his name is madhav chavan , and he created something called pratham .
and what can we learn from all of that ?
and they all have the same kind of features : highly collaborative , very personalized , often pervasive technology , learning that starts from questions and problems and projects , not from knowledge and curriculum .
thank you .
now , i &apos;m sitting here trying to figure out &quot; the gay lifestyle , &quot; &quot; the gay lifestyle , &quot; and i keep hearing this word over and over and over again : lifestyle , lifestyle , lifestyle .
when my partner , steve , and i first started dating , he told me this story about penguins .
and that is , apparently , this is just another move by the gay activists that &apos;s on the gay agenda .
run for your heterosexual lives .
he is starting a new club at school , policy debate .
think about that .
as i was approaching my late 40s , when i would wake up in the morning my first six thoughts would all be negative .
and here &apos;s an example of what i mean .
and i realized that , in order to know where i was going , i had to know where i &apos;d been .
if however , we can go back and alter our relationship , re-vision our relationship to past people and events , neural pathways can change .
and the answer of course , like so many things in the world , is sex .
these are the anthers of a lily , cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it , the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with .
and under the scanning electron microscope , you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at .
and if you look down into it , there &apos;s this sort of dam past the spadix , flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals , little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container .
insects see green , blue and ultraviolet , and they see various shades of ultraviolet .
that &apos;s the main use of that filter .
but it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s the red sox , right ?
pause for about 10 seconds .
this is the game , which i &apos;ve ended up calling the new world , because i like the phrase .
we change as people through games , because we &apos;re involved , and we &apos;re playing , and we &apos;re learning as we do so . thank you .
you can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer .
this is looking at another event . this is called queen &apos;s day .
and i started collecting sheep .
and there &apos;s this reference to &quot; le petit prince &quot; where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep .
you see some people did beautiful stipple renderings , like this one on top -- spent a long time making realistic versions .
i &apos;m sorry for this .
as you know , an animation is a series of images .
and you can also see the way that it was drawn .
i am a papercutter .
and people told me -- like these 36 views of the empire state building -- they told me , &quot; you &apos;re making artist books . &quot;
so the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image , so it makes a very freestyle architecture .
it goes from slave trade to over-consumption of sugar with some sweet moments in between .
i started with small images , i started with a few miles .
it &apos;s not autobiographical identities .
and each time i make public art , i want something that &apos;s really relevant to the place it &apos;s installed .
and it &apos;s called &quot; seeds of the future are planted today . &quot;
but more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world .
that is snobbery .
we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please .
and the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops .
they own their success . but they also own their failure .
there is another source of solace and comfort for all this .
my favorite is sophocles &apos; oedipus the king : &quot; sex with mum was blinding &quot; in a way , if you like , at one end of the spectrum of sympathy , you &apos;ve got the tabloid newspaper .
my own theory of success -- and i &apos;m somebody who is very interested in success . i really want to be successful .
but what i really want to stress is by all means , success , yes .
alain de botton examines our ideas of success and failure -- and questions the assumptions underlying these two judgments . is success always earned ? is failure ? he makes an eloquent , witty case to move beyond snobbery to find true pleasure in our work .
this picture is supposed to be me during training .
are your shoulders ready ?
and i started swimming , and , oh my god , it was glassy .
then come convulsions .
and i got back in .
and i said , &quot; well it &apos;s odd that you &apos;ve learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit , but yeah , i know those guys . &quot;
and i want to live every day of the rest of my life that way , swim or no swim .
diana nyad : extreme swimming with the world &apos;s most dangerous jellyfish
what if , on your phone , which will be available in the next few weeks , you had every minute of your sleep displayed ?
this is me now . and you can see the ecg .
it &apos;s like a wireless accelerometer , pedometer .
it &apos;s usually 90 percent . so , you tell me you sleep better than expected .
eighty percent of americans have chronic disease , or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have two or more chronic disease , 140 million americans have one or more chronic disease , and 80 percent of our 1.5 , whatever , trillion expenditures are related to chronic disease .
one of many different techniques using wireless sensors .
we can prevent , or have the earliest detection possible , for breast cancer with an ultrasound device given to the patient .
education : how do we improve education ?
the future must have some computers . &quot;
the stuff has a very short half-life , same with brain science .
this is a problem of such and such a type , and therefore there &apos;s a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that problem .
he &apos;s developed a very avant-garde cuisine .
but we had a philosophy , which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second .
so we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world .
everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage , right ?
we make every aspect of this burger .
and while i &apos;ve tried to make my images not too graphic , keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do , because , after all , what a surgeon does to a patient , if it were done without consent , would be a felony .
but surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold , trephinating ancestors .
surgery didn &apos;t hurt anymore , but it killed you pretty quickly .
these techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated .
you can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart without cracking the chest .
what if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place ?
this is a cancer surgery .
many of you , all of you maybe , will at some point , or have already , faced a diagnosis of cancer , or heart disease , or some organ dysfunction that &apos;s going to buy you a date with a surgeon .
plastics cause serious problems , such as the destruction of ecosystems , the pollution of natural resources , and the reduction of available land space .
phthalates are horrible because they &apos;re so easily taken into our bodies .
mw : so now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates , we wondered what these bacteria were .
thank you . jy : thank you .
too much rain falls on some areas , and not enough on others .
and charles just checking it out there .
so i &apos;ve always liked this prototype picture .
they tried to solve the design problem .
it was part of the business of life in general .
also rode on one . i ...
ed : and then embassy row is actually a historical site , because in the kymaerican story this is where the parisian diaspora started , where there embassy was .
but here is what &apos;s really great .
but it is that process that has happened within the man that changes the banana leaf .
i went out and did a lit review , 3,000 articles on the key word &quot; slavery . &quot;
now , how on earth did we get to a situation like this , where we have 27 million people in slavery in the year 2010 ?
now , that kind of slavery is , again , pretty much what slavery has been all through human history .
there &apos;s a lot of vulnerable people out there . it &apos;s very exciting .
his name is james kofi annan . he was a slave child in ghana enslaved in the fishing industry , and he now , after escape and building a new life , has formed an organization that we work closely with to go back and get people out of slavery .
but most of the people in the world in slavery live in those places where the costs are lowest .
we said to her , &quot; are you worried ? are you upset ? &quot;
and these electrons , while flowing , they collide with the atoms , and in these collisions they lose a certain amount of energy .
and when i place it on top of a regular magnet , it just stays locked in midair .
and i can even try a new thing ; let &apos;s try it for the first time .
but he didn &apos;t have wikipedia .
so i did and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy -- completely useless for what i was trying to do .
plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .
that &apos;s it without the case on .
and that really describes information technology .
and i just updated these graphs .
and halfway through the project , skeptics said , &quot; well , this is not working out . you &apos;re halfway through the genome project and you &apos;ve finished one percent of the project . &quot;
we ultimately will merge with this technology . it &apos;s already very close to us .
so we &apos;re very appreciative of the support we &apos;ve gotten from both the intellectual leaders , the high-tech leaders , particularly google and nasa .
he said he &apos;d lived his whole life there by the beach , and that he would rather die there than run .
i &apos;m now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami that also were shown on blogs .
one of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically , and , of course , the internet more generally -- and it &apos;s going to seem like a very obvious point , but i think it is an important one to think about -- is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content every day , who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing , linking , commenting on the substance of the internet , are doing so primarily for free .
you know , if you think about something like google , which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information -- we know that google does an exceptionally good job of doing that , and it does that because , collectively , this disorganized thing we call the &quot; world wide web &quot; actually has a remarkable order , or a remarkable intelligence in it .
so , one of the phenomena that &apos;s very clear in the blogosphere is that once a meme , once an idea gets going , it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on , because other people have , say , a link .
whole arm . shoulder disarticulation .
a couple of weeks ago we took it down to walter reed , which is unfortunately more in the news these days .
in addition to that , it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on earth , and much of it we don &apos;t know about .
now , i come from newfoundland in canada -- it &apos;s an island off the east coast of that continent -- where we experienced one of the worst fishing disasters in human history .
and so this is a photograph from the 1950s .
we can also use satellite tags to track animals as they move through the oceans .
and it contains all the data from the census plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute .
for example , while it &apos;s hard to believe that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists , it did until a few years ago when south african fishermen requested an export permit and scientists realized that this was something new to science .
we found life in the extremes .
and so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye .
when we look at pictures like this , they take our breath away , in addition to helping to give us breath by the oxygen that the oceans provide .
it fits into the environment . it is the environment .
so , the assignment i &apos;ve been given may be an insuperable obstacle for me , but i &apos;m certainly going to try .
the indo-european root of the word hope is a stem , k-e-u -- we would spell it k-e-u ; it &apos;s pronounced koy -- and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from .
it is an elevation of us beyond ourselves .
of course , in this day and age , the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that bush in washington that can get -- can get in the way .
there is no other reason to have a brain .
that problem is solved .
and this is her getting the world record in real time .
now what i want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to reduce the negative consequences of this sort of noise and variability .
so let me give you an intuitive example .
so as you send a movement command down , you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions .
and then we &apos;re going to ask them to rate a bunch of things including ticklishness .
and we hypothesize based on the tickling study that when one child hits another , they generate the movement command .
so it re-shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts .
maybe there &apos;s variation in the population .
but it &apos;s also relevant for disease and rehabilitation .
it was taken in 1965 .
mars has the largest impact crater in the solar system , hellas basin .
this is ice water on mars .
and this is the terrain it appears over , and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on mars .
we invited 10 of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two days .
how do we transport an airplane to mars ?
because we have tested ares model , several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the nasa langley research center for eight years , under mars conditions .
in this talk , planetary scientist joel levine shows some intriguing -- and puzzling -- new discoveries about mars : craters full of ice , traces of ancient oceans , and compelling hints at the presence , sometime in the past , of life . he makes the case for going back to mars to find out more . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i suppose we are . &quot;
then you notice that if that lego-provided cad program isn &apos;t enough , there &apos;s an entire open-source , third-party , independent lego cad program that lets you do 3d modeling and 3d rendering and make , in fact , movies out of lego , 3d films of which there are thousands on youtube , and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people recreating all sorts of things .
lego blocks : playtime mainstay for industrious kids , obsession for many mature adults . hillel cooperman takes us on a trip through the beloved bricks &apos; colorful , sometimes oddball grownup subculture , featuring cad , open-source robotics and a little adult behavior .
they committed that they &apos;re going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent , and their new stores by 30 percent , and do all that in seven years .
and wal-mart has committed they &apos;re going to sell another 100 million light bulbs in the coming year . but it &apos;s not easy .
please . thank you .
but brazil &apos;s only 1.3 percent of the world &apos;s co2 emission .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re investing 200 million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies .
and if it &apos;s business as usual , we &apos;re going out of business .
because if we do , i can look forward to the conversation i &apos;m going to have with my daughter in 20 years .
so , as all of you probably know , the classic way of thinking about this is the diffusion-of-innovation , or the adoption curve .
and this is called the &quot; degree &quot; of a node , or the number of connections that a node has .
so , how can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network ?
among the friends , the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero in adoption of the innovation , for example , would be evidence of an impending epidemic .
and by behaviors , i can mean things like criminal behavior , or voting behavior , or health care behavior , like smoking , or vaccination , or product adoption , or other kinds of behaviors that relate to interpersonal influence .
and we can use such data , that &apos;s being passively obtained , to map these whole countries and understand who is located where within the network .
in fact , the availability of these data , i think , heralds a kind of new era of what i and others would like to call &quot; computational social science . &quot;
together , the inhabitants created public spaces and designed them to feel more like a home and less like an unfinished tower .
when out on the water , it &apos;s clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living .
throughout the day , it &apos;s quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets , just like this engagement party .
when i asked people why they were digging their houses from the ground , they simply replied that they are poor wheat and apple farmers who didn &apos;t have the money to buy materials , and this digging out was their most logical form of living .
and this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job .
and they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry .
here chris took the object out of its hand , and baxter didn &apos;t go and try to put it down ; it went back and realized it had to get another one .
mildred &apos;s a factory worker in connecticut .
the percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically .
let me show you how it works .
these would be used for education , cultural tourism , etc .
in order to sustain our work into the future , we use technology centers where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them , whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites , and at the same time , it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future .
we were very lucky to have two of our partners participate in this : the historic scotland , and the glasgow school of art .
why no hearings , no denunciations , no people getting arrested in front of the rwandan embassy or in front of the white house ? what &apos;s the deal ?
it &apos;s diverse . it &apos;s got a lot of different approaches .
so we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century , and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here , as we speak .
the place that i turned to answer that question was to a man that many of you may not have ever heard of , and that is a brazilian named sergio vieira de mello who , as chris said , was blown up in iraq in 2003 .
sergio was in beirut when the u.s. embassy was hit by the first-ever suicide attack against the united states .
he &apos;s a brazilian in these places . he speaks seven languages .
he had a lot of flaws , but he was very adaptive .
we put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we &apos;ve spent three billion .
i think the short answer is : no , not unless we let it .
this is not a negotiable thing , hunger .
in fact , what we know now is that every 10 seconds we lose a child to hunger .
this is something that can be transformed with knowledge .
what we have found working with the world bank is that the poor man &apos;s safety net , the best investment , is school feeding .
so add in five percent , 10 percent more food .
what if from the women in africa who cannot sell any food -- there &apos;s no roads , there &apos;s no warehouses , there &apos;s not even a tarp to pick the food up with -- what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children elsewhere ?
the amazing thing i &apos;ve found is nothing can change on a big scale without the determination of a leader .
and this is something that sobers us in our field everyday in that , obviously , we &apos;ve made remarkable impacts on cardiovascular disease , but look at cancer . the death rate in cancer in over 50 years hasn &apos;t changed .
as one gets older ? very , very common .
when one is exposed to h1n1 , you take tamiflu , and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease .
it &apos;s what we call a system .
it &apos;s a staggering device , not because it tells me how many kilocalories i do every day , but because it looks , over 24 hours , what i &apos;ve done in a day .
you change that system , and you could have a marked effect on the cancer .
so this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet , and we &apos;re able to get resolution where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body .
what &apos;s interesting is they did it in south america and canada , where it &apos;s &quot; more ethical to give placebos . &quot;
yesterday , the national cancer institute announced a new program called the physical sciences and oncology , where physicists , mathematicians , are brought in to think about cancer , people who never approached it before .
we stand on street corners , shouting over noise like this , and pretending that it doesn &apos;t exist .
if you have to work in an open-plan office like this , your productivity is greatly reduced .
most of you recognize that immediately .
sound is complex . there are many countervailing influences .
the punchline to your journey ? look at the horizon .
what do you eat ? one of my favorite dishes on expedition : butter and bacon . it &apos;s about a million calories .
extreme runner ray zahab shares an enthusiastic account of his record-breaking trek on foot to the south pole -- a 33-day sprint through the snow .
and i &apos;m living proof .
that may have been true 10,000 years ago , and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100 , especially in the last 50 , we &apos;ve drawn down the assets , the air , the water , the wildlife that make our lives possible .
we need new deep-diving submarines .
this is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea .
the bad news is that you have to look hard to find them .
a global plan of action with a world conservation union , the iucn , is underway to protect biodiversity , to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change , on the high seas and in coastal areas , wherever we can identify critical places .
now , david and hidehiko and ketaki gave a very compelling story about the similarities between fruit flies and humans , and there are many similarities , and so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies , the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this , for example -- but in my talk , i don &apos;t want to emphasize on the similarities between humans and fruit flies , but rather the differences , and focus on the behaviors that i think fruit flies excel at doing .
we have no idea what they do .
a mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly .
you can take a hardware and have that hardware do different things at different times , or have different parts of the hardware doing different things .
it &apos;s part of their visual guidance system .
and we &apos;ve done , in the past four years , a proof of concept on a small part of the rodent brain , and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up to reach the human brain .
he &apos;s at home having tea .
in fact , the neocortex in the human brain is evolving at an enormous speed .
how many trees does it have ?
so it &apos;s very unlikely that you got the same fabric , the same circuitry .
and in fact you need one laptop to do all the calculations just for one neuron .
so , in summary , i think that the universe may have -- it &apos;s possible -- evolved a brain to see itself , which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself .
ted taylor , who led the project , was going to take his children .
and that &apos;s why when you get something declassified , that &apos;s what it looks like .
if you saw the 1959 ... this is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment ; that &apos;s acceleration profile .
so that &apos;s the end . all i can say in closing is , we heard yesterday that one of the 10 bad things that could happen to us is an asteroid with our name on it .
until somebody said , &quot; look , if you &apos;re serious about this , you first have to write a book about your research . you have to publish something , and then you &apos;ll get the opportunity to write something else .
no , right ? it &apos;s impossible .
i want you to think about illusion as a metaphor .
and finally , depending on your particular version of european similarity , you can think about the u.k and france as either similar culturally or not .
they are residing in the person who is designing that form .
here is a patient . he is a 67-year-old farmer .
i hope this worries you , by the way -- when you go to see your physician .
now i looked at this and i called up the economist .
one more example of this .
the silver lining is , i think , kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting .
and radio waves are limited .
it &apos;s good for a nice suntan , but otherwise dangerous for the human body .
an led is a semiconductor . it &apos;s an electronic device .
put your book beneath it and you can read .
efficiency : this is data through illumination -- it &apos;s first of all an illumination device .
this is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean .
you &apos;re walking around ; your car has 12 microprocessors .
and with these four letters , you can create a language : a language that can describe anything , and very complicated things .
you might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes .
it &apos;s all hidden in this code , and it &apos;s starting to be understood at breakneck pace .
they &apos;ve also discovered that there &apos;s a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well .
and , again , this is , sort of , my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology : you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in .
we can &apos;t make the grape plant produce babies .
then , number two , we keep these rules a secret from the dog .
&quot; hold his front paws , squeeze his front paws , stamp on his hind feet , squirt him in the face with lemon juice , hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper , knee him in the chest , flip him over backwards . &quot;
then we phase out the food as a lure , and now the dog knows that &quot; sit &quot; means sit , and you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly constructed english sentence .
they &apos;re like golden retrievers .
it does not have to be nasty , scary or painful .
dogs deserve better .
and i thought , &quot; do i tell this jerk to quit it ? &quot;
you know , calculus is wonderful .
william , hi . good to see you .
and you made it out of what ?
wk : um -- what do you -- i mean -- do you want to build another one ?
i &apos;m kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it .
or ears being able to hear themselves -- it &apos;s just impossible .
i want to talk to you briefly about perception .
and here is one of my paintings .
64 becomes 6,400 .
in the case of hare , it &apos;s an ambiguous sound in english .
lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
there was no progress , no innovation .
as adam smith said , &quot; no man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . &quot;
that is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
they were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
and how long has it been going on ? and what does it mean ?
it looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
it &apos;s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
what &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
this is an image i just recently completed , that is -- when you stand back at a distance , it looks like some kind of neo-gothic , cartoon image of a factory spewing out pollution .
and this particular one is about cigarette addiction .
and so , as you stand back , you see 213,000 vicodin pills , which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the united states , and anti-anxiety medications .
and if we can find that , then we &apos;ll be able to find , within each one of us , what it is that we need to find to face the big question , which is : how do we change ?
this is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop .
i talked about that -- you know , that situation where you go into the clinic and you don &apos;t get diagnosed ?
we don &apos;t know what the sequence is ; just pull them out of the field .
we put a ton of virus up this guy &apos;s nose . so -- -- i mean , we wanted it to work . he really had a cold .
we put the beeper in the clinic .
everything came back negative , over 100,000 dollars worth of tests .
and we know who &apos;s got defects in rnasel and who doesn &apos;t .
this was all done by folks in the lab -- i cannot take credit for most of this .
the battery was invented about 200 years ago by a professor , alessandro volta , at the university of padua in italy .
you &apos;re looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter .
the electrons go to work in the real world out here , powering our devices .
along the way we scaled up to the 20 watt-hour cell .
liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature with minimum regulation .
so rov stands for remote operated vehicle , which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra-thin tether back to the computer topside .
but we were able to do it , we got all the kits made , thanks a lot to techshop , which was a big help to us , and we shipped these kits all over the world just before christmas of last year , so it was just a few months ago .
and at the time i didn &apos;t think much about it , but then later , i realized that that was the high point of my education .
we might sneak up on this little guy over here maybe , and try and eat him .
and i can see how it might dance .
i want them , after they &apos;ve played this game , to have extracted an entire world that they &apos;re now interacting with .
now one of the tools i can eventually earn for my ufo is a monolith that i can drop down .
thank you .
and we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
so the arms up in the v , the chin is slightly lifted .
like , can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful ?
so what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
also , our bodies change our minds .
but what &apos;s driving it ? it &apos;s not about the content of the speech .
and the night before my first-year talk , and the first-year talk at princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people . that &apos;s it .
so this is two minutes .
and yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking .
there are a lot of ideas to die for .
and no other species does anything at all like it .
yesterday , negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but -- what &apos;s a virus ?
and so they had a ready supply of converts .
these memes are spreading around the world and they are wiping out whole cultures .
what you can do , however , is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence .
you end up like some kind of rabid windmill .
and that showed me such a fundamental truth , that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words cannot .
did you know that ted is a tune ?
audience : t , e , d .
it &apos;s going to be britain &apos;s first ever national disabled orchestra .
now this prince loved his music , but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time , which is just on the austro-hungarian border , a place called esterhazy -- a long way from the big city of vienna .
i &apos;m working in kigali , rwanda , jogging through the steep slopes , when i see , 10 feet in front of me , a little boy -- 11 years old -- running toward me , wearing my sweater .
understand , however complex we may be , incentives matter .
one is in india , where there are 240 million farmers , most of whom make less than two dollars a day .
a lot of hurdles .
she brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets , five dollars apiece , despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one , and we learned a lot about how you sell things .
it doesn &apos;t divide by nine .
as i &apos;ve spent the last better part of three decades , almost four , traveling the world , trying to work , getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela , some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet , i &apos;ve been asking myself that question .
perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what &apos;s really at stake .
now let me take you for a moment to what &apos;s widely regarded as the world &apos;s most difficult conflict , or the most impossible conflict , is the middle east .
what would that mean ? what is the story there ?
they need to be able to live the story . how would you do that ?
we then came to northern jordan , to jerusalem , which is all about abraham , to bethlehem , and finally to the place where he &apos;s buried in hebron .
last month , there was a piece in the guardian , in the manchester guardian , about it -- two whole pages .
now the acorn is associated with the oak tree , of course -- grows into an oak tree , which is associated with abraham .
the third side is us .
he got a medical doctor .
okay . all right .
ten percent of those same 7,800 houses had safe electrical systems , and 58 percent of those houses had a working toilet .
simply not done , the house doesn &apos;t work .
he was loaned to us by a mining company .
we went in with no grand plan , no grand promises of a great program , just the offer to build two toilets for two families .
he &apos;s trebled his crop income , more food for the family and more money for the family .
it &apos;s sort of like thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids , with a live television audience of millions .
in other words , we can be politically right but emotionally wrong .
thank you .
and you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds .
so , you may wonder what does a wall like this really do for kids , besides changing landscapes and mindsets ?
and when the local senator gets on the scale in public and says he &apos;s got to lose weight , so do i !
and thank god trinity wall street noticed , because they gave us the birth of green bronx machine .
but this is my weekly paycheck for kids ; that &apos;s our green graffiti .
now , you may ask about these kids .
people , you can all do that .
thank you , god bless you and enjoy the day . i &apos;m steve ritz .
and what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin , like you see in an emergency room , and i &apos;m going to show you why they don &apos;t work very well .
and when you go to the farmyard , you can &apos;t easily get pigs to have heart attacks , so we said , well , we &apos;re experts in stents .
then it goes to a network operations center , where they get your data from your patient database that &apos;s been put in at some central location , say , in the united states .
and finally he says , &quot; ok , now i &apos;m going to -- &quot; all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse .
well , &quot; responsive electrical stimulation &quot; means that we sense , at a place in your brain which is called an &quot; epileptic focus , &quot; which is where the epileptic seizure begins -- we sense there , that it &apos;s going to happen , and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot , which erases the errant signal so that you don &apos;t get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache .
and some of the sponsors of this ted meeting are such organizations .
i have a couple of ideas to begin with .
and in that time we prototyped and built , in about three days , a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them .
how do you decide what is important ?
at tedu 2009 , erik hersman presents the remarkable story of ushahidi , a googlemap mashup that allowed kenyans to report and track violence via cell phone texts following the 2008 elections , and has evolved to continue saving lives in other countries .
i have no idea how i &apos;m going to do it , but i am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book , and leave that published book for my son .
i &apos;m here to talk about books .
so , that &apos;s sort of to put it in perspective here .
and we &apos;ve also been working with a number of other organizations .
what &apos;s really making all of this happen ?
it &apos;s no wonder that everybody &apos;s getting into it , right ?
we get over 500,000 unique visitors per month , just to our particular site .
now , i was asked by chris to talk about some of the big issues , and so i figured i &apos;d start with the three that at least drove me to do this .
the parents love it , because when they open up the laptops , it &apos;s the brightest light source in the house .
and that &apos;s why scale counts .
ok , i &apos;ve been using laptops since their inception .
and in about 30 days we &apos;ll know for sure whether this works .
so i can &apos;t quite name them .
because there &apos;s no market for post office trucks .
so it &apos;s not a matter of whether it &apos;s going to happen . it is going to happen .
but now what we &apos;re looking at is not an extension of the physical self , but an extension of the mental self , and because of that , we &apos;re able to travel faster , communicate differently .
and he said , &quot; that is the shortest distance between two points . &quot;
and so what happens is , when we bring all that into the social space , we end up checking our phones all the time .
we &apos;re just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other , regardless of geography .
but you go to rwanda -- a very small country -- 8,000 mothers with hiv who are pregnant .
and it &apos;s the same with nurses .
but we &apos;re here to talk about possible solutions and some good news .
they &apos;re hired -- they &apos;re paid as professional members of the health care teams , just like doctors and nurses .
now the groups , it &apos;s not like me lecturing , but what happens is women , they come together -- under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers -- they come together , and they share their personal experiences .
i tell them my story , that i am hiv-positive , but my child is hiv-negative .
we need to change attitudes to women in africa .
mothers caring for mothers .
so in my lab , we &apos;re interested in the social brain , that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people .
they &apos;re parodied , sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage behavior . they take risks , they &apos;re sometimes moody , they &apos;re very self-conscious .
it actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and social development . thank you .
and i went to carnegie mellon , and i earned my phd in robotics .
as it was operating , my students and i were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden .
so now , we &apos;re working with doctors at ucsf and engineers at johns hopkins and we &apos;re building a robot that has a number of , it &apos;s a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles , and as you can see here , they can avoid delicate organs and still reach the targets they &apos;re aiming for .
here &apos;s seven times .
i grew up in the wild eastern part of south africa at a place called londolozi game reserve .
solly was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where i grew up in mozambique .
solly remained on the bank .
he wades in to above his waist .
and yet , for the next five years she returned in the winter months .
thank you .
now kaesava had a baby boy called rehan a couple of weeks ago .
you know , sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic .
maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives .
history as an imaging tool ?
i came here today to talk about what &apos;s wrong with our food system .
next , more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables , like pesticides and herbicides , to kill weeds and bugs .
not too long ago , my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal .
ten years ago was a seminal trip , where we explored that big iceberg , b-15 , the largest iceberg in history , that broke off the ross ice shelf .
and i said , &quot; yeah .
phoenix islands is a major tuna location .
sea levels are rising , and kiribati , along with 42 other nations in the world , will be under water within 50 to 100 years due to climate change and the associated sea-level rise from thermal expansion and the melting of freshwater into the ocean .
and i was free for dinner , and i went out to dinner with the minister of fisheries in kiribati .
so we had very strong leadership , very good vision and a lot of science , a lot of lawyers involved .
we just had our first pipa trust board meeting three weeks ago .
the great recession ended when american gdp resumed its kind of slow , steady march upward , and some other economic indicators also started to rebound , and they got kind of healthy kind of quickly . corporate profits are quite high . in fact , if you include bank profits , they &apos;re higher than they &apos;ve ever been .
a lot of people look at this and they say , &quot; okay , but those are very specific , narrow tasks , and most knowledge workers are actually generalists , and what they do is sit on top of a very large body of expertise and knowledge and they use that to react on the fly to kind of unpredictable demands , and that &apos;s very , very hard to automate . &quot;
and then some cheery soul usually always pipes up and says , &quot; hey , don &apos;t forget about plagues . &quot;
the work of innovation is becoming more open , more inclusive , more transparent , and more merit-based , and that &apos;s going to continue no matter what mit and harvard think of it , and i couldn &apos;t be happier about that development .
so the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard .
you know , of course , they are related to this combination of at least two of them being , you know , design objects .
this is , you know , a book .
this is at p.s. 1 -- a sculpture that &apos;s basically a square room by james turrell , that has a retractable ceiling .
then : working concentrated , without being frazzled .
again , it &apos;s the same thing -- &quot; guts &quot; is just the same room , reworked .
the other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments , such as the arctic or deserts , where there are periodic food shortages , and occasionally there just isn &apos;t enough food to keep everyone alive .
the other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society &apos;s cultural values .
hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth .
at the same time , older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change , but that could come back .
their children are more self-confident , more independent , and more socially skilled than are our children .
these are clearly biblical archetypes , and the thinking behind that was to create positive , globally-resonating storylines that could be tied to the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of because then the person that &apos;s using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message .
he had told his advisers , &quot; get me all the scholars to translate any book they can get their hands onto into arabic , and i will pay them its weight in gold . &quot;
number one , we have a thing within islam that you don &apos;t leave a boy and a girl alone together , because the third person is temptation or the devil , right ?
my wife is a saudi from yemeni roots .
you know , maybe next week , next month , next year , but , you know , it &apos;ll come out . &quot;
i won &apos;t send any more commandos in until i know it &apos;s safe .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
this is islam &apos;s influence on hinduism and judaism .
just today , d.c. comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover .
and this little pixel in the corner -- three billion -- that &apos;s their climate change fund .
bird flu .
so , i &apos;ve been working as a data journalist for about a year , and i keep hearing a phrase all the time , which is this : &quot; data is the new oil . &quot;
but if you ask the right kind of question , or you work it in the right kind of way , interesting things can emerge .
your sense of sight is the fastest .
but is it true that america has the biggest military budget ?
take a look at this one .
i think , &quot; no , no . i don &apos;t want to take any synthetics , i just want to see plants and -- just show me herbs and plants . i &apos;ve got all the natural ingredients . &quot;
it has a magnetic quality that draws me in .
now what you are smelling is a combination of -- i asked how many molecules there were in there , and nobody would tell me .
but the first theory is : it must be the shape .
a theory is something that enables you to do less work .
if it didn &apos;t , the whole idea was toast , and i might as well move on to other things .
electrons are fuzzy creatures , and they can jump across gaps , but only at equal energy . if the energy differs , they can &apos;t jump .
so they asked us to make a new coumarin . and so we started doing calculations .
luca turin : the science of scent
and one of the things i &apos;m most proud of is this agreement for ibm .
alan siegel : let &apos;s simplify legal jargon !
the adoptive parents were lined up .
i was a sign from god , they said .
twenty-four hours later , my social worker , this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months , he &apos;s waiting for me in the car as i say goodbye to my parents .
see , that &apos;s what family does .
but as far as we know , we &apos;re the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet earth today , except for the bonobos .
not many people can say that .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re still trying to find answers to , and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species , and our ancestors are no exception .
so , homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave africa and begin its spread across the globe .
we &apos;ve only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species , yet we &apos;ve reached a population of more than six and a half billion people .
everyone was very excited about this archaeological find , because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton .
it &apos;s exactly how i made my living for 15 years .
again , like i said , my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell , and also making them for myself , obtaining them , appreciating them and diving into them .
what do they do , how do you start something like that ? i really don &apos;t know .
and they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years , until it got stolen in january of 2007 .
and when i held my bronze one up against my sculpey one , it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch .
i &apos;d broken my neck and my back in six places .
the next concern was whether i would walk again , because i was paralyzed from the waist down .
they moved me from intensive care to acute spinal .
and i said , &quot; not me , not janine the machine , &quot; which was my nickname .
and i wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance .
is that a problem ? &quot;
and as i looked up , i realized that he was pointing towards the blue mountains where the journey had begun .
and mom and dad ? never been up .
we respond so well to form , but i &apos;m interested in creating intelligent form .
this is what i show to the client to say , &quot; that &apos;s what i want to do . &quot;
i design for that condition , biopolymers . it &apos;s the future .
it &apos;s made from polysaccharides and proteins .
i make organic things which are essential .
we need to be in that realm . i want to do stuff like that .
how you grow legs out of a surface .
there is no engine . there &apos;s a solar panel on the back , and there are batteries in the wheels .
i built this thing for my studio .
so i &apos;m just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you &apos;ll see in the video .
and when i see ed &apos;s photographs i think , why the hell am i going to china ? it &apos;s true .
i saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room , pumping out so much light that i could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight ; and puffs and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke ; and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters -- just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire , but these were icy , blue embers .
but you don &apos;t always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this .
so it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper &apos;s scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen .
but he still knows a good thing when he sees it , and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss .
and once this display gets going , i &apos;m not touching it anymore .
but there came a moment when it all came together , and everything worked .
edith widder : glowing life in an underwater world
while all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
i look . both are of the male sex .
real nobel laureates hand you the prize .
these are cane toads in australia .
so i &apos;ll conclude to invite you all to dead duck day .
at the start , though , i had to memorize the names you give for each color , so i had to memorize the notes , but after some time , all this information became a perception .
and also , some rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes , and some bjork or madonna desserts , that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs .
and i like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels , and then i ask people , &quot; which one do you prefer ? &quot;
you might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two .
now , we &apos;ve been taught to believe that law is the foundation of freedom .
and of course the hindsight bias is perfect .
you could have a separate section of a law library around each of the following legal concepts : due process , special education , no child left behind , zero tolerance , work rules ...
&quot; caution : contents are hot , &quot; on billions of coffee cups .
then you &apos;ve wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests .
life is too complex for a software program .
the problem is , we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values .
so there is among many people -- certainly me and most of the people i talk to -- a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working , with the way our institutions run .
maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave .
and aristotle said , &quot; hah , they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns , you need to bend the rule . &quot;
he panicked about being able to support his family .
he won the appeal .
first , they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity .
so canny outlaws are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time .
stayed with them , followed up on them , made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump .
in addition to which there &apos;s an enormous amount of back and forth , mentoring of one student by another , of all the students by the doctors , and the result is a generation -- we hope -- of doctors who do have time for the people they treat .
so , a big question that we &apos;re facing now and have been for quite a number of years now : are we at risk of a nuclear attack ?
it stands for mutually assured destruction .
less than two percent . about 1.4 percent of the population , as far as anyone knows , did anything , either making a space in their basement or actually building a bomb shelter .
it &apos;s not completely gone . i &apos;m going to come back to that .
well , there &apos;s a lot of know-how out there .
this is alexander lebed , who was a general that worked with yeltsin , who talked about , and presented to congress , this idea that the russians had developed -- these suitcase bombs . they were very low yield -- 0.1 to one kiloton , hiroshima was around 13 kilotons -- but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage .
so , first of all , this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine .
but in 2008 , there isn &apos;t one single american city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster .
nuclear terrorism is possible -- it may be probable -- but is survivable .
now , i think many have seen business as the problem , or at least one of the problems , in many of the social challenges we face .
these problems still seem very daunting and very intractable , and any solutions we &apos;re achieving are small solutions .
it &apos;s meeting needs at a profit that leads to taxes and that leads to incomes and that leads to charitable donations .
i &apos;m proud of that .
it makes the business more productive and efficient .
shared value is capitalism , but it &apos;s a higher kind of capitalism .
for students , it &apos;s quite an experience , but for a school , it could be very difficult or expensive to maintain .
so our doctors said these are eye candies .
yep .
coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself pondered the cosmos from their armchairs .
they felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the 17th century .
each month required 1,365 calculations , so these tables were filled with mistakes .
that &apos;s the heroic part of their story .
i wasn &apos;t really a rocket scientist , but i was working at the jet propulsion laboratory in sunny california where it &apos;s warm ; whereas now i &apos;m in the mid-west , and it &apos;s cold .
it &apos;s actually not life , it &apos;s a crystal .
and so if you go and ask yourself , &quot; what on earth is artificial life ? &quot; , let me give you a whirlwind tour of how all this stuff came about .
but what is this system like ?
in fact , it should perhaps make use of the concepts that i developed just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be . &quot;
here is , in fact , what you get if you , for example , look at the distribution of amino acids on a comet or in interstellar space or , in fact , in a laboratory , where you made very sure that in your primordial soup that there is not living stuff in there .
i can tell you indeed it is , because this type of spectrum , just like what you &apos;ve seen in books , and just like what you &apos;ve seen in amino acids , it doesn &apos;t really matter how you change the environment , it &apos;s very robust ; it &apos;s going to reflect the environment .
so the first thing that we learn is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone , without referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear , as far as the type of life on earth is .
we don &apos;t know for really basically any of the clinics in the developing world , which ones have medicines and which ones don &apos;t .
and what makes it even worse is that that &apos;s just the beginning , because once you &apos;ve collected all that data , of course someone &apos;s going to have to -- some unfortunate person is going to have to type that into a computer .
but to me , the most significant thing that i saw in 1995 was this .
that means you had to know i existed .
they don &apos;t require any consultants , because the business model for all these businesses requires that something be so simple we can use it ourselves with little or no training .
physicians for human rights -- this is moving a little bit outside the health field — they are gathering , they &apos;re basically training people to do rape exams in congo , where this is an epidemic , a horrible epidemic , and they &apos;re using our software to document the evidence they find , including photographically , so that they can bring the perpetrators to justice .
we have to keep everything under control .
habits , certainties , convictions , exclamation marks , paradigms , dogmas .
and when we calculated we thought we &apos;re never going to make it around the world at that speed .
that &apos;s the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking .
and i think it &apos;s a nice metaphor also for the 21st century .
so the question is , how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big christmas tree ?
so , you see that this airplane is more a symbol .
so , you see , this is what we &apos;re doing on our side .
now , you need a laptop .
don &apos;t ask .
the right to live , period .
and deep down , if we really accepted that africans were equal to us , we would all do more to put the fire out .
the problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re-describe ourselves to the world .
what on earth can we all do about this ?
most of you started out wanting to change the world , didn &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot , but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world .
because we also need your intellectual capital : your ideas , your skills , your ingenuity .
you see , if this is true , and i believe it is , that the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter , this should be a piece of piss .
i would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day .
we can make history .
nurses getting better training , pharmacists being able to order supplies , doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine .
elvis uses it , but so does shakespeare in this famous line from &quot; romeo and juliet : &quot; juliet is the sun .
and many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic .
agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing , as in , &quot; the nasdaq climbed higher . &quot;
now metaphor is ubiquitous , yet it &apos;s hidden .
so many people are there .
the yemen times already has a strong reputation in yemen as an independent english language newspaper .
and when i became editor-in-chief after my brother actually -- my father passed away in 1999 , and then my brother until 2005 -- and everybody was betting that i will not be able to do it .
n as you know , the image of a lot of yemeni women is a lot of black and covered , veiled women .
and very , very difficult times .
pm : &quot; shake the dust . &quot;
you may not know this , but you are celebrating an anniversary with me .
my father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for ph , but after six months , i couldn &apos;t walk up a small hill . i couldn &apos;t climb a flight of stairs .
he was a big figure in all of our lives , and we loved him very much .
i went back to the states , anticipating i &apos;d return to europe , but the heart catheterization showed that i wasn &apos;t going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from johns hopkins hospital .
and everybody was really happy for me , but me .
i couldn &apos;t walk , i couldn &apos;t talk , i couldn &apos;t eat , i couldn &apos;t move , i certainly couldn &apos;t sing , i couldn &apos;t even breathe , but when i looked up and i saw my mother , i couldn &apos;t help but smile .
now it &apos;s very easy actually to get a chemical compound from products into the human body through the skin .
it &apos;s the number one contaminant of groundwater , drinking water , rain water .
it &apos;s a plasticizer .
the evidence of that is that studies in rats , again with atrazine , show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion .
help me .
as evident in this slide from lake nabugabo in uganda , the agricultural runoff from this crop , which goes into these buckets , is the sole source of drinking , cooking and bathing water for this village .
that &apos;s the percentage we recycle .
hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish , like cigarette lighters ...
we sort the plastic fragments into different size classes , from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter .
the north coast of california has rainforests -- temperate rainforests -- where it can rain more than 100 inches a year .
chris , could you extend your arm out that way ? there we go . ok .
my wife and i adore our children .
but then you enter the redwood canopy , and it &apos;s like coming through a layer of clouds .
what you &apos;re seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal , of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks .
what they &apos;re doing in the redwood forest canopy soil hundreds of feet above the ocean , or how they got there , is completely unknown .
we are human , and we have the capacity to love , we have the capacity to wonder , and we have a sort of boundless curiosity , a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates , i think .
think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
so let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos i took while i was in pakistan .
you know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers .
and they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
but just keep staring at it .
and he put blogged images about the car accident -- that &apos;s his mercedes -- right here is the lada samara he crashed into .
everything is reliant on these computers working .
in order to predict effectively , we need to use science .
terrorists , they &apos;re rational .
with five decision-makers there are a lot of linkages -- 120 , as a matter of fact , if you remember your factorials .
and how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue ?
i want to be very clear here . i &apos;m not projecting some past data into the future .
who are the winners and who are the losers in iran ?
it would be a good thing if people paid more attention , took seriously , and engaged in the same sorts of calculations , because it would change things . but it would change things in two beneficial ways .
here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content .
and they put advertising against it and linked from it to itunes .
by simply blocking all reuse , you &apos;ll miss out on new art forms , new audiences , new distribution channels and new revenue streams .
they want to teach me about my destiny .
they could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars , the sequence and direction of waves , the flight patterns of certain birds .
we must course-correct .
my excitement is : i get a chance to give something back .
they &apos;re only going to get magnified by the very technology that &apos;s connecting us , because it &apos;s making us intersect . and that intersection doesn &apos;t always create the view of &quot; everybody now understands everybody , and everybody appreciates everybody . &quot;
so , the question we &apos;ve got to ask ourselves really is , what is it ?
but , how easy for me to tell him what he should do .
audience : aye .
your model of the world is the filter . that &apos;s what &apos;s shaping us .
we need variety . we need surprise .
aren &apos;t you glad you came to this positive visit ?
next year eight . i wasn &apos;t doing it for brownie points , but after eight , i thought , shit , i could use some help .
her friend , her new boyfriend , wanted to marry her , and she said no .
i &apos;ve been playing ted for nearly a decade , and i &apos;ve very rarely played any new songs of my own .
you know , as i look around the world i see a lot of gaps , and i think we all see a lot of gaps .
and sad , negative feelings are darkly colored .
we see , &quot; i just feel like i &apos;m not going to have fun if it &apos;s not the both of us . &quot; that was from someone in michigan .
and if i hold down my cursor , they do a little dance .
what makes you sad ? what do you believe in ? and so on .
and it caused me to wonder about our world today .
and it &apos;s kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world &apos;s current mythology over the last couple of months .
you can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source . this one &apos;s from al jazeera .
have you ever noticed how much people moan about them ?
or seeing the big , white , puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the abominable snowman going to rob a bank .
these clouds are bombing along , but from all the way down here , they appear to be moving gracefully , slowly , like most clouds .
these clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere .
so keep looking up , marvel at the ephemeral beauty , and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds .
and this is what we have to deal with .
so she &apos;s really the driving force behind the development of graphics-processing units .
so these are fantastic images .
and this is also again showing us what we can do .
so if you have the opportunity , please try it out .
and he &apos;s sitting there in front of the haptic device , the force feedback system , and he &apos;s moving his pen towards the heart , and the heart is now beating in front of him , so he can see how the heart is beating .
this is another sequence of motts &apos; brain .
and we &apos;ve been experimenting with this .
so i thought i &apos;d start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why i lead this schizophrenic life .
he said , &quot; ok . i measured the height of a brick .
and she &apos;s right . it &apos;s a question we &apos;ve all been avoiding .
no hope of describing that .
this is very graphically shown by the worldmapper website and project .
so i had an idea . and the idea was very simple .
you have to rethink , what is the university for ?
and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green .
he &apos;s about to finish his ph.d. , and he was filmed recently with someone you all know .
we want to roll out 15 aims centers in the next five years , all over africa .
thank you .
now , let &apos;s compare this with the brain .
information processing is very dynamic and adaptive .
and the reason why that &apos;s happening is that , right now , in 2007 -- the technology that we are using -- a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously , side by side .
and it &apos;s brittle , because each of these steps has to be flawless , otherwise you lose that data , whereas in the brain , you have a system that stores data in a distributed way , and it &apos;s robust .
and so , here you go .
researcher kwabena boahen is looking for ways to mimic the brain &apos;s supercomputing powers in silicon -- because the messy , redundant processes inside our heads actually make for a small , light , superfast computer .
that means you , your neighbor , your cellphone , the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the schwarzschild radius .
an ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star &apos;s life .
again , a source of energy that &apos;s very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars .
if there were no massive objects these things would go flying off , or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit .
this technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that &apos;s continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you .
so , we &apos;re cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume .
so , you shouldn &apos;t see young stars .
and i hope , if nothing else , i &apos;ve convinced you that , one , we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
and i think inspired by that memory , it &apos;s been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as i can , sort of pass it on through whatever means .
they &apos;re locations in the spectrum of sound .
now some of the greatest composers , like bach , were combinations of these two things .
37 freakin &apos; vibrations .
people could now hear music all the time , even though it wasn &apos;t necessary for them to play an instrument , read music or even go to concerts .
that &apos;s what drives my interest in projects like the tv series &quot; keeping score &quot; with the san francisco symphony that looks at the backstories of music , and working with the young musicians at the new world symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education .
then of course , at the dawn of aviation , all of the great inventors of the time -- like hargreaves , like langley , even alexander graham bell , inventor of the telephone , who was flying this kite -- were doing so in the pursuit of aviation .
and this is where we &apos;re actually going .
thank you .
next , i make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers .
goldie hawn : thank you . choose five ?
it &apos;s a phenomenon that i think any organization or individual can tap into .
what is going on here ?
and amazingly , you can still see what the best can do , because the crowd itself shines a light on them , either directly , through comments , ratings , email , facebook , twitter , or indirectly , through numbers of views , through links that point google there .
we opened up our talks to the world , and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers &apos; ideas , and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers .
cisco actually estimates that , within four years , more than 90 percent of the web &apos;s data will be video .
so it &apos;s not far-fetched to say that , at some point , online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance .
that just went global .
that changes everything , right ?
because of a scarcity of land , we are using the sacks to grow vegetables , and also &#91; we &apos;re &#93; able to save on the cost of living .
whereas , if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen , girls , aircraft -- actually , i would like to hear that talk , but statistics say it &apos;s not so good .
slides are okay , though you might consider going for props .
so i &apos;m going to take as inspiration the fact that we &apos;re all interested in interacting with other people , i &apos;m going to completely strip it of all its complicating features , and i &apos;m going to turn that object , that simplified object , into a scientific probe , and provide the early stages , embryonic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact .
i won &apos;t go through the details of it , but that &apos;s an important discovery , and we know a good bit about that now , and it &apos;s just a small piece of it , but it &apos;s important because those are the neurons that you would lose if you had parkinson &apos;s disease , and they &apos;re also the neurons that are hijacked by literally every drug of abuse , and that makes sense .
they keep you alive . it gives them the pie , it gives that kind of a behavioral punch which we &apos;ve called a superpower .
we &apos;re so good at this we don &apos;t really even notice it .
thanks for having me .
and if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today , i think you can completely , as i &apos;ve said , remake politics , remake government , remake your public services .
it had sucked all that power up from the localities .
and the third of these big changes : accountability .
we all know we need to recycle more .
unfortunately , there &apos;s one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better , and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world .
let &apos;s look at the best academic performer : the province of shanghai , china .
sarah brown wessling : good morning everybody .
i &apos;ll see you later .
it &apos;s a great time to be a molecular biologist .
it &apos;s a vibrant , global community of hackerspaces , and this is just the beginning .
well , working with the safe organisms that we normally work with , the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating , like , some sort of superbug , that &apos;s literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the sahara desert .
you can make some sort of a biofuel cell .
and so it was , our man presented himself to authorities in the kingdom , looking forward to settling into his new life .
wow . wow .
and so that &apos;s just programmed into you .
these are terrible and tragic figures .
it &apos;s called harm reduction , and it involves , among other things , providing clean needles and syringes , offering opioid substitution therapy and other evidence-based treatments to reduce drug dependence .
and so we need to ensure that these people who are living with hiv or at greatest risk of hiv have access to legal services and they have equal access to the courts .
you had centralized energy production .
maybe not the way people dress , but -- you know , the question now is , how can we have all the good things that we identify with cities without all the bad things ?
the highline in manhattan is very similar .
housing is another area where we can really improve .
we think these little wireless sensors are more effective .
and they are thought to be able to filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour and can feed on 30 kilos of zoo plankton a day to survive .
this is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide -- it is the finning of sharks .
there &apos;s great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout the world .
we got 50 in three days off inishowen peninsula .
all he knows is where he tagged them and he knows where they popped off .
and yet , if you look at whale sharks , which is the other plankton eating large shark , its diversity is much greater .
they didn &apos;t get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail .
all it was doing was breaking my arrows because the shark skin is just so strong .
you can only rarely be in the right place to find sharks into august .
you want to learn as much as you can .
it was fantastic .
so i went undercover as a man who was interested in this particular business , of course .
reporter : when metro news contacted investigative reporter anas aremeyaw anas for his reaction , he just smiled and gave this video extract he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen .
my kind of journalism might not fit in other continents or other countries , but i can tell you , it works in my part of the continent of africa , because usually , when people talk about corruption , they ask , &quot; where is the evidence ?
well , you &apos;re an amazing human and you &apos;ve done amazing work and you &apos;ve taught us a story like no story i think any of us have heard before .
the boxes are too narrow .
when i would go to the bathroom , i would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like i was peeing standing up .
i had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls , much like myself , who fell kind of between-the-lines -- girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear , girls who had boys &apos; haircuts but wore girly nail polish , girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees , girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything .
and then we made this .
that video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today i have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
and i am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative , because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice , i invite you to go out and try to be grey .
so please don &apos;t greet us as strangers , greet us as your fellow human beings , period .
and when he did , michael , the archangel , was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels .
because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera , they took pictures of everything . more than 1,000 .
we look at what &apos;s inside of the person , the bad apples .
there &apos;s a study some of you think you know about , but very few people have ever read the story . you watched the movie .
the problem is , at the end of the line , it &apos;s 450 volts .
he persuaded them to commit mass suicide .
you could tell it wasn &apos;t a real jail .
if they don &apos;t change their appearance , only one of eight kills , tortures or mutilates .
those abuses went on for three months . who was watching the store ?
he was the one that stopped those abuses you saw , because when he saw those images , he turned them over to a senior investigating officer .
fifty-year-old african-american construction worker .
let &apos;s oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad , and let &apos;s focus on the positive .
and even more -- and this is something that one can be really amazed about -- is what i &apos;m going to show you next , which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real connections , real pathways .
now the first part , the first problem , is relatively easy -- it &apos;s not easy at all -- but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience .
and of course , the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina .
if you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life-permitting survival range , you go into disease or death .
i promise not to say anything about this , except this is to frighten you .
and everybody &apos;s dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree .
antonio damasio : the quest to understand consciousness
they were the co-authors of a book called &quot; manifesta . &quot;
feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of walmart .
i went out and i worked at a non-profit , i went to grad school , i phone-banked , i protested , i volunteered , and none of it seemed to matter .
cornel west says , &quot; of course it &apos;s a failure .
but the truth is it doesn &apos;t really matter which sage said it first , because it &apos;s still sage advice , even today .
it means we &apos;ve got to get out of here .
i may also be interested in knowing how focused i am , so i can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side .
and it could join into the relationship with you .
and this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what &apos;s going on inside of ourselves .
or you could tag facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention , just like this .
if you could think it , if you could discover it , you could bring it to life .
i am , and have been since birth , legally blind .
and so when i heard that eye specialist tell me all the things , a big fat &quot; no , &quot; everybody imagines i was devastated .
and two years in , i really could see very little .
and that eye specialist , he didn &apos;t bother testing my eyes .
and i went home , and , because the pain in my chest ached so much , i thought , &quot; i &apos;ll go out for a run . &quot;
do something different . what do you want to be ?
and together we would trek a thousand kilometers across india .
and the one thing is that a really good friend of mine , he texted me on the way over , knowing i was scared .
it &apos;s really , really tiring .
the other dog doesn &apos;t have the button .
at least pre-kahneman perhaps , we didn &apos;t have a really good model of human psychology to put alongside models of engineering , of neoclassical economics .
here &apos;s a beautiful example of a psychological solution deployed in korea .
it &apos;s probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a dvd player . &quot;
so where economists make the fundamental mistake is they think that money is money .
so if you &apos;re a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer , you created true value .
it has to be said of the germans that the germans and the french are doing a brilliant job of creating a united europe .
nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever .
his name is nostradamus , although here the sun have made him look a little bit like sean connery .
now actually , in 1993 , the researchers who did that 1980 study , that early study , published a mea culpa , an apology to the scientific community , in which they said , &quot; when we carried out our study in 1980 , we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance . &quot;
only three of the negative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published .
and if you want to read the full correspondence and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company , you can see that written up in this week &apos;s edition of plos medicine .
we maintain that , put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales .
but here we see the complex trajectory of the cassini mission color coded for different mission phases , ingeniously developed so that 45 encounters with the largest moon , titan , which is larger that the planet mercury , diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase .
so , that &apos;s my first idea . and we all know about the mozart effect -- the idea that &apos;s been around for the last five to 10 years -- that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby &#91; in utero &#93; , that it &apos;ll raise our iq points 10 , 20 , 30 percent .
we &apos;ve had good enough , really , very powerful effects with kids around the world , and now people of all ages , using hyperscore .
if i were here playing cello , or playing on a synth , or sharing my music with you , i &apos;d be able to show things about myself that i can &apos;t tell you in words , more personal things , perhaps deeper things .
so instead of being grand opera , this opera will turn into what we &apos;re thinking of as personal opera .
and this was actually the least interesting part of the work , you know , the design process . we needed an input ; we needed continuous tracking ; in the software , we look at the types of shapes he &apos;s making .
but instead of making it very literal , showing you exactly the camera tracing , we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement , and shows the way it &apos;s being analyzed .
and odysseus does his best job playacting and says , &quot; untie me . untie me .
but then there &apos;s this other self , the future self .
i had to write five pages a day towards papers or i would have to give up five dollars .
you say , &quot; well , of course i can &apos;t write today , because i &apos;m giving a tedtalk and i have five media interviews , and then i &apos;m going to a cocktail party and then i &apos;ll be drunk after that .
but aren &apos;t there things that we believe and don &apos;t believe at the same time ?
as you move down the ladder of apartments , you see that they get worse and worse .
the older face is miserable .
every day , we make decisions that have good or bad consequences for our future selves . daniel goldstein makes tools that help us imagine ourselves over time , so that we make smart choices for future us .
so this is al-shalan -- the unknown thing .
now when we do that , we discover some startling things about mental illness from a global perspective .
in reality , take a guess .
just over 30 years ago , the nations of the world assembled at alma-ata and made this iconic declaration .
and amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation that , in fact , we were losing natural capital -- the benefits that flow from nature to us .
but when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice ?
and these are percentages versus the original state , so to speak , the pre-industrial era , 1750 .
this is not illegal stuff , this is basically business as usual , which causes climate-changing emissions , which have an economic cost .
just a year later the yangtze flooded , causing something like 5,500 deaths .
and by the way , these are my favorites -- externalities calculation and green carbon markets .
as you can see , they cut across the entire globe all the way from micronesia across indonesia , malaysia , india , madagascar and to the west of the caribbean .
he was a philosopher ; he was a drum player ; he was a teacher par excellence .
they took him for lunch to a sandwich place in pasadena .
can you build a machine that thinks like a human being , that is conscious ?
i don &apos;t think he was right .
i apologize for the sexist conversation here , but this is the way it really happened .
it was due to a russian mathematical physicist , and it was a complicated theory .
it was the technique of feynman diagrams .
what do you see ?
what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces .
he said one he would like to make a real trailer , functioning , and we would sell that one .
i don &apos;t have children .
whether we remember it or not , it &apos;s a -- it &apos;s the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things .
number three -- throw a spear .
driving a car is a -- is a really empowering act for a young child , so this is the ultimate .
assuming you live a long life , there &apos;s a 50 percent chance you &apos;ll develop arthritis .
and so that &apos;s not going to be a solution that &apos;s going to get us global with biologic tissue .
we &apos;re going to resurface it with a completely new surface .
the astronauts each got to carry about ten silk flags in their personal kits .
more tomorrow . i also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for pictures .
part of the question that i have answered is , is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli : with human achievement , with history , with the things that drive us and make us human -- the passionate discovery , the bones of dinosaurs long gone , the maps of space that we &apos;ve experienced , and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination .
we think about the internet ; we think about information that goes across the internet .
i usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say , that &apos;s really cool , but what &apos;s it good for ?
because i have some limited time , i &apos;ll cut it off for a second , and tell you about how it works and what it &apos;s good for .
and hopefully they &apos;ll be sensitive that they don &apos;t want to offend you with just one more outlet .
all of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear .
i &apos;m serious . and they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance , and see a fraction of a degree kelvin in temperature shift from 100 yards away when they play this thing .
so , i &apos;ve been really lucky as an inventor .
six years ago , after 20 years in graphic design and typography , i changed the way i was working and the way most graphic designers work to pursue a more personal approach to my work , with only the humble attempt to simply make a living doing something that i loved .
but then as well , i was able to just flip them , rotate them and combine them in different ways to create either regular patterns or abstract patterns .
and to experience wonder is to experience awe .
it didn &apos;t exactly work out that way .
this year , i got , what i really have to say is a rather brilliant idea , to laser cut my valentines out of used christmas cards .
and i actually really feel that it &apos;s worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way .
you may have wondered what happens if i give the robot a little push .
thank you .
but anyone who &apos;s ever had , or knows , small children knows they &apos;re incredibly complex organisms .
and they can pull calcium out of the environment , put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate , calcium and carbonate .
and so we use a virus that &apos;s a non-toxic virus called m13 bacteriophage that &apos;s job is to infect bacteria .
but it &apos;s basically -- you can pull one out of a billion .
so i &apos;m going to talk about work , specifically why people can &apos;t seem to get work done at work , which is a problem we all kind of have .
and then you &apos;ll hear people say , &quot; well , it doesn &apos;t really matter where i am , as long as it &apos;s really early in the morning or really late at night or on the weekends . &quot;
and what you find is that , especially with creative people -- designers , programmers , writers , engineers , thinkers -- that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done .
i don &apos;t think anyone would say yes .
i mean , is this china ? what the hell is going on here ?
the manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together , and it &apos;s an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people -- is to say , &quot; hey look , we &apos;re going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting .
these things don &apos;t exist outside of the office .
so maybe it &apos;s every other week , or every week , once a week , afternoons no one can talk to each other .
jason fried : why work doesn &apos;t happen at work
i go in their homes . and we do this worldwide , and we follow them around town with video cameras .
and they value that connectivity .
ok , now , that sounds like something you get on a chinese fortune cookie , right ?
so let &apos;s say , june , you &apos;re in a village , rural village .
and this is where they take the stuff that breaks , and they fix it , and they put it back into circulation .
this doesn &apos;t have house numbers . this has phone numbers .
the next thing is that , however we design this stuff -- carefully design this stuff -- the street will take it , and will figure out ways to innovate , as long as it meets base needs -- the ability to transcend space and time , for example .
ok , the gentleman on the left is saying , &quot; screw you , i &apos;m going to check my device . &quot;
we are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience , which will create the new world .
and the cardiac pet scan shown on the lower left , the blue means no blood flow .
and now his shoulder says , &quot; wino forever . &quot;
because the inability to experience regret is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics of sociopaths .
and most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain .
and for the first several hours , there was exactly one thought in my head .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s also a fifth one .
now obviously , those kinds of regrets are incredibly piercing and enduring .
when other people see my tattoo , for the most part they like how it looks .
it reminds us that we know we can do better .
when the tsunami hit south asia , the united states contributed 1.2 billion dollars .
so we worked on improving the productivity of the operations and the supply chain , and went to a low-margin , high-volume , absolutely certain-payment business .
so organizing these markets is one thing we try to do .
now , we started working together 18 months ago .
that &apos;s 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area .
these people have been through a lot and none of us , most of all me , helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other .
it &apos;s a tiny , little island -- 60 miles by 90 miles .
so we basically turned the box into a bubble .
so we had some good ideas : we took old automobile windshields , put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard .
all the fences at green school are green .
you practice ancient balinese arts .
the yellow box was called the administration complex .
join john hardy on a tour of the green school , his off-the-grid school in bali that teaches kids how to build , garden , create . the centerpiece of campus is the spiraling heart of school , perhaps the world &apos;s largest freestanding bamboo building .
my carotid artery had ruptured .
when i find myself in a conversational situation , i need to type fast and to jump right in .
these are a few of the comments i recorded for use when chaz and i appeared on the oprah winfrey program .
but so far , the apple alex voice is the best one i &apos;ve heard .
the point is plato was only 50 years ago , an instant in time .
for me , the internet began as a useful tool and now has become something i rely on for my actual daily existence .
you should never let your wife read something like this .
the guy says , &quot; i want a second opinion . &quot;
let me tell you my story .
other examples you can see here are from latvia , lithuania , estonia -- the central european countries .
and i put strategy at the top of it .
i &apos;d like to dedicate this one to all the women in south africa -- those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid .
i was running across the street , and the only thing that i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head .
that &apos;s another story we won &apos;t even get into .
and somebody donated tennis shoes for me .
but for me , i was an adult and it was embarrassing , and i had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips , and capture the air and get the word out .
and i was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me , and also the guide dog and skill set i had gained .
a peasant , who was walking to market that morning , ran towards where the gunshot had come from , and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor , clearly shot by a dueling wound .
but on a larger scale of biology , actually symmetry is very important , because it actually communicates genetic information .
seven of them are exactly the same , and the eighth one is turned upside down .
for galois , symmetry -- unlike for thomas mann , which was something still and deathly -- for galois , symmetry was all about motion .
it &apos;s got no reflective symmetry .
if i do one magic trick move followed by another , the combination is a third magic trick move .
take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn , then flip it . and then do it in the other order , and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction .
and the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars .
it will make you immortal .
21 . okay good . how many do you have in yours ?
they were making it possible for us to do what they do , and yet , they didn &apos;t really understand how they did it .
the physicians of the ancient world -- especially the egyptians , who started medicine as we know it -- were very conscious of what they could and couldn &apos;t treat .
now there is something else , though , in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated .
so chemists got to work , and they developed a bactericide that became widely used in those systems .
the mentor of warren buffett , benjamin graham , developed his system of value investing as a result of his own losses in the 1929 crash .
for some reason , there &apos;s no standard syllabus , there &apos;s no basic course .
so you don &apos;t need to go into the recent calls list , so if you &apos;re trying to get through to somebody , just hit the call button again .
it &apos;s extremely frustrating on any camera under 1,000 dollars .
so i kind of have a -- this is bumptop .
more boring , but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping .
thank you .
and similar topography .
what &apos;s your act two ?
all they had was just a monitor in front of them that had the numbers on it and just a red button that said , &quot; stop . &quot;
pragmatic chaos is , like all of netflix algorithms , trying to do the same thing .
these are the ones where you have to press what floor you &apos;re going to go to before you get in the elevator .
and the reality is that the further away you are from that , you &apos;re a few microseconds behind every time .
and we will have to understand those as nature , and in a way , they are .
js : again .
it &apos;s smart enough to stop .
small roundabouts are starting to appear .
the answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely .
fifty percent of traffic accidents happen at intersections . gary lauder shares a brilliant and cheap idea for helping drivers move along smoothly : a new traffic sign that combines the properties of &quot; stop &quot; and &quot; yield &quot; -- and asks drivers to be polite .
so that brings us to the first problem that i &apos;ll raise this morning , which is how do we stop a deadly disease that &apos;s spread by mosquitos ?
and rich men are afflicted .
now we &apos;re on the upswing .
in fact , in the united states , the teaching system has worked fairly well .
now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has invested in this .
you might think these are people with master &apos;s degrees .
they take the poorest kids , and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges .
and so that &apos;s sort of working in the opposite direction .
i only had time to frame those two problems .
it was supposed to break , but that &apos;s okay .
as he often did , velázquez put himself in this painting too .
and she said , &quot; probably never . &quot;
but the person who put it back together , instead of hiding the cracks , decided to emphasize them , using gold lacquer to repair it .
and you were walking along and you were handing the lollipops out to people in line and talking about shinerama .
but it is so scary to think of ourselves as that powerful .
we need to shine light to see what we &apos;re doing .
we &apos;ve made a good job . we &apos;ve taken it out .
the molecule they had developed had three parts .
so even if the tumor is not right on the surface , you &apos;ll still be able to see it .
some of these are swollen lymph nodes that look a little larger than others .
we haven &apos;t had that many complications . &quot;
i think that it &apos;ll change the way that we do surgery .
quyen nguyen : color-coded surgery
and this process , which takes just a millisecond or so , happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells , as long as you live and think and feel .
and also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry .
you take this dna and you put it into a neuron .
this animal &apos;s going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there , and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that .
and there &apos;s a little clock in the lower left-hand corner , so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this .
and new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus , which probably most of us around this room have , and it doesn &apos;t have any symptoms , which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body .
now mice are smart , so this mouse solves the maze eventually , but he does a brute-force search .
and by turning things off , it &apos;s more or less a zero .
we looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated , where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable , but they made them operable for our study .
and for this reason , many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora .
i walked up along hudson street -- where jane jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what i was writing in &quot; emergence &quot; -- past the white horse tavern , that great old bar where dylan thomas drank himself to death , and the bleecker street playground was filled with kids .
same thing to the question of , who was keeping the streets alive post-9 / 11 in my neighborhood ?
now , they &apos;re more innovative -- well , google &apos;s pretty innovative -- but there are some new twists on this .
there &apos;s a problem with the google zeitgeist , which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for britney spears pictures , which is not necessarily news .
and by the way , chris , that would &apos;ve been a really good panel , i think , right there .
now this is a very interesting thing .
from mother to daughter , preacher to congregant , teacher to pupil , storyteller to audience .
it was an education of the most profound and transformative kind .
as they watch more films their lives got palpably richer .
in a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on table mountain and playing cops and robbers .
we guessed that film , whose stories are a meeting place of drama , music , literature and human experience , would engage and inspire the young people participating in filmclub .
this is a bird .
if the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the clean air act , then i see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as , &quot; brain death for all children . no child left behind . &quot;
clean soil is a critical problem -- the nitrification , the dead zones in the gulf of mexico .
you can &apos;t farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries without understanding nutrient flow .
because in poetics , as margaret atwood pointed out , &quot; we write our history on the skin of fish with the blood of bears . &quot;
so instead of just growing destruction , we want to grow the things that we might enjoy , and someday the fda will allow us to make french cheese .
the idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever , some of the materials go back to soil -- it &apos;s all solar-powered .
we &apos;re building a new city next to this city ; look at that landscape .
and this is the concept for the top of the city .
this is five times larger .
we didn &apos;t know about this . we didn &apos;t know about prism .
and every single one of these companies denies .
let &apos;s take , for example , sweden .
are the americans ready to throw away the constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists ?
and this is all the kind of information we are giving away , we are giving away to the united states .
the solution is open source .
it &apos;s the place where you &apos;re deciding right now you probably aren &apos;t going to order the steak for dinner .
and each neuron itself is largely unique .
and men are much more likely to have their significant other , spouse , give consent than the other way around .
so again this is what they can see under the microscope .
so roughly , we have 50 million data points for a given human brain .
so drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off , etc .
and i think every human , we all have different genetic backgrounds , we all have lived separate lives .
we &apos;re certainly going to be looking at more .
maybe you look at the past and see .
and the world has spent a lot of money on it : the gavi and the gates foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it , and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort .
maybe that &apos;s the solution , maybe we should send kids to school .
well , part of the problem , surely , is people do not fully understand .
so what do we find ?
we can know the answer to this question .
they need to know : out of all the things i could do , what is the best way to achieve my goals ?
so for every hundred dollars you spend doing that , you get 40 extra years of education .
but look what we just did today .
there is no miracle cure , but modern medicine is saving millions of lives every year , and we can do the same thing .
slavery .
the lesson from that was that it was africa -- an african story -- that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds .
and while africa may be dark , the thing that brought the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing , but it &apos;s also the opportunity .
more fascinating , you have other countries -- south africa , mauritius , namibia -- all in single digits .
bing capital &apos;s acquisition of edcon , a large retailer , is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy .
but with africa , let &apos;s start being careful about this .
the banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation , from over 80 banks to 25 banks . strengthening of the system .
now , when looking at africa vis-a-vis other things , and countries in africa vis-a-vis other things , comparisons become important .
thank you .
and aren &apos;t we grateful that we have hearts that can feel these vibrations in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure and the beauty of nature ?
you flip a switch and there is electric light .
tom hanks : hello , houston , this is odyssey .
so i showed him this , and this is actual footage that he was on . this is apollo 15 . this was his mission .
jim went three miles went down , and i went about three miles away from the studio and photographed this in a garage .
that doesn &apos;t move . &quot;
ok , reverse your hands .
kt : how are you ?
kt : there &apos;s a wall , there &apos;s a wall .
kt : that is weird .
you might want to use the stairs , there .
nicole : no .
ok , excellent . open your eyes .
and i only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release , but only when you feel the pressure release .
you can wait as long as you want .
excellent .
and i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side .
kb : ok , steve , come on up here .
now , steve , you know where the spike is , but nobody else , does ? correct ?
kb : ok , where are you ? put out your hand .
sj : i &apos;m going to say no .
one in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness , so if it was one , two , three , four , it &apos;s you , sir .
because they became my only friends , they became my friends , because very few people that i knew -- well , i wasn &apos;t sent a lot of cards or flowers . i mean , if i had had a broken leg or i was with child i would have been inundated , but all i got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up .
so actually , it &apos;s filled with 100 billion neurons just zizzing away , electrically transmitting information , zizzing , zizzing . i &apos;m going to give you a little side view here .
thank you .
in rodents , it was known to make mothers care for their offspring , and in some creatures , allowed for toleration of burrowmates .
so in these countries , more economic transactions occur and more wealth is created , alleviating poverty .
that &apos;s not what we found .
and whenever we raise oxytocin , people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers .
i &apos;m working at a gas station on the outskirts of santa barbara , california .
he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;ve been so nice , let &apos;s split the reward . &quot;
but interestingly , high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish .
why ? because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species .
and it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s brains to release oxytocin .
they created a global computer made up of people .
how is present-day schooling going to prepare them for that world ?
i repeated the experiment there .
they did that , and watch a little bit of this .
so i said , &quot; well , what did i expect ? &quot;
kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in new delhi , a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher .
there is evidence from neuroscience .
okay ?
the net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons .
help me build this school .
i &apos;ll follow her advice . i &apos;ll stop talking .
it &apos;s kind of a funny , goofy sound to do .
because of this , all three brothers and their families had to vacate their home .
in this project i wanted to work in the opposite direction and find an absolute catalog , something that i couldn &apos;t interrupt , curate or edit by choice .
you may notice in several of the chapters that i photographed there are empty portraits .
during the time i was in bosnia , the mortal remains of zumra &apos;s eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave .
and finally , another individual sat for me from behind and later rescinded his participation , so i had to pixelate him out so he &apos;s unrecognizable .
in a 12-month period when i was at the orphanage , only one child had been adopted .
taryn simon captures the essence of vast , generation-spanning stories by photographing the descendants of people at the center of the narrative . in this riveting talk she shows a stream of these stories from all over the world , investigating the nature of genealogy and the way our lives are shaped by the interplay of many different forces .
however , what i have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music .
and so on . if i think of myself as a musician ...
under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms , no legs -- they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand .
because that isn &apos;t giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic , and something that i can fully experience the journey of .
and you know , i just find that i have to give those pieces of music real time .
this is how we experience music . of course it &apos;s not .
&quot; well , how ? why do i need to learn that ? i need to relate it to a piece of music .
it &apos;s a video game move from &quot; star fox . &quot;
there are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream , the ones i &apos;ve just shown you , but every day , every month , people are producing thousands of these .
it &apos;s that they weren &apos;t putting me at the top of this list ; they were actually -- it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top 21 places to spell &quot; marblecake . also , the game . &quot;
got a couple questions for you .
99 percent of it is just , would have been , you know , bleeped out .
the content is not dinner table conversation in the least .
really interesting questions . i think a lot of it has to do with body size .
you go into an area like this , you get a geologic map , you get a topographic map , and the best , most-inspired team you can bring to the area .
and you really have to be able to withstand conditions -- you have to drive into the desert , you will see landscapes in many cases -- you can see from what we &apos;ve discovered -- that nobody else has ever seen .
it &apos;s only been with us for less than a century , and in that time , that fourth dimension , when radioactive dating came about , less than a century ago , and we could actually tell how old some of these things were , is probably the most profound transformation , because it changes the way we look at ourselves and the world dramatically .
look at that set of choppers ! yeah , he &apos;s a big one .
we proved with those measurements that crocodiles scaled isometrically .
they did it within two or three degrees of the pole , to maintain similarity between continents .
i worked up a portfolio , and i was headed to new york .
and the question is -- and we started to address this question for centuries -- as to how we get these kids involved in science .
she &apos;s 37 years old , she hasn &apos;t won a marathon of any kind in eight years , and a few months previously she almost died in childbirth .
it &apos;s a heartwarming story , but if you drill a little bit deeper , you &apos;ve got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there .
australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain .
now i &apos;ve been to a lot of marathons , and i &apos;ve yet to see any ...
if you wonder , why it is the tarahumara don &apos;t fight and don &apos;t die of heart disease , why a poor ethiopian woman named derartu tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive , and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons , perhaps it &apos;s because humans , as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe , actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs .
they need to be part of the pack .
if you read folklore and mythology , any kind of myths , any kind of tall tales , running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor .
because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence , up until the 1970s or so , the benefits , social and physical and political and mental , could be astounding .
kismet : scientist : this is a watch that my girlfriend gave me .
so what i &apos;ve learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology , where it &apos;s actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality .
the task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table , discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task -- this ended up being a survival task -- and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were .
and as grandma-bot , she can now play , really play , with my sons , with her grandsons , in the real world with his real toys .
to explore that question , we did a study in the boston area where we put one of three interventions in people &apos;s homes for a period of several weeks .
i like to think of this as the atari pong of this blended-reality play .
but i can tell you , the thing that they love the most is the robot .
got to get some new gear . there &apos;s no other way .
it wasn &apos;t enough for me to join a slam competition , and while those things hold weight , it wasn &apos;t the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad .
and i said to him , &quot; listen , punk fool , you &apos;re a failed actor who became an agent , and you know why you failed as an actor ?
there was a sort of a standstill in britain the moment of her death , and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way .
in the photograph , the real subject doesn &apos;t exist so it makes you want that person more .
i was exploring , at the time , the hyperbole of icons -- and diana and marilyn -- and the importance of celebrity in our lives .
i &apos;m not really interested in the celebrity themselves .
and i think it doesn &apos;t really matter that my work is considered humorous , in a way ; i think it &apos;s a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery .
there &apos;s no comparison at all .
if you cannot secure the parents , you cannot guarantee the security of the african child .
i &apos;m here to talk to you about solutions .
very soon we will all be dead and gone , but the problems will stay , unless we have people taking over from where we stopped .
look at mrs. jones . look at the study , tell me what you think . &quot;
we have taken care of over 1,000 indigent patients that could have died , including four free pacemakers in patients with complete heart block . for those that understand cardiology , complete heart block means certain death .
there &apos;s been no doubt around my colleagues about the utility of the training i received here , and i think there &apos;s been an increased interest now in -- particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting .
and one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things , you know , that bill gates talked about this morning .
now , when i was a young kid i didn &apos;t know my thinking was different .
now , when kids get to be in third or fourth grade , you might see that this kid &apos;s going to be a visual thinker , drawing in perspective . now , i want to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker .
but sensory is an issue . some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights ; others have problems with sound sensitivity .
now , let &apos;s say i figure out it &apos;s an equipment problem .
he was now dr. carlock in the movie .
i was taught that when i was very , very young .
he was a nasa space scientist .
is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them , as some might , as most , wish ?
so magic is a very introverted field .
uh oh .
and the debate has raged , hasn &apos;t it , since the greeks , of isn &apos;t it what it &apos;s all about ?
the highs were high , the awe , i &apos;m not a religious person , but i &apos;ll tell you , to be in the azure blue of the gulf stream as if , as you &apos;re breathing , you &apos;re looking down miles and miles and miles , to feel the majesty of this blue planet we live on , it &apos;s awe-inspiring .
so here we go , and i somehow , without a decision , went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting stephen hawking and the parameters of the universe , i just went into thinking about this dream , and why , and how .
and we &apos;ll never forget it . it &apos;ll always be part of us .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
earlier this year , in march , clay took his own life .
he goes home to kansas city , missouri .
a post that read : &quot; goodbye . &quot;
the more ideas there are in circulation , the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with .
and if i had to pick a group that i think is our invisible college , is our generation &apos;s collection of people trying to take these tools and to press it into service , not for more arguments , but for better arguments , i &apos;d pick the open-source programmers .
when you adopt a tool , you also adopt the management philosophy embedded in that tool , and he wasn &apos;t going to adopt anything that didn &apos;t work the way the linux community worked .
this is a graph of the ruby community .
this is a called a &quot; diff , &quot; this thing on the right here .
t.s. eliot once said , &quot; one of the most momentous things that can happen to a culture is that they acquire a new form of prose . &quot;
wherever anybody else looks , look somewhere else , and go do something different , you know , and doing that .
there &apos;s the heavy-hitting sound of rock .
so , next time you are really depressed , look in the mirror and you can look and say , hi , i &apos;m looking at a star here .
if i zoom on it , you can see : that &apos;s the rover on the surface .
okay , we have parachute aligned .
erik bailey : the main purpose of edl is to take a spacecraft that is traveling at 12,500 miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt in a soft way in a very short amount of time .
now the spacecraft actually has to decide when it &apos;s going to get rid of its parachute .
first we start by we want to have our employees to be as imaginative as they can .
so we came up with this ingenious idea , which is used here on earth for helicopters .
well , there were two satellites which were particularly interesting .
and then with an instrument we have on board , a radar instrument , we found there are lakes like the great lakes in here , so it looks very much like earth .
and when i met harriet in person the next year at the ted conference , she &apos;d gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype t-shirts .
now i mentioned the phone .
let &apos;s get personal . i won &apos;t ask who here &apos;s had a colonoscopy , but if you &apos;re over age 50 , it &apos;s time for your screening colonoscopy .
only for about 20 percent of actual visits do you have to lay hands on the patient .
there &apos;s even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate .
still in clinical trials , but imagine when we can connect these , for example , to the amazing bionic limb , such as the deka arm built by dean kamen and colleagues , which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who &apos;s lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they &apos;ve had in the past .
again , in early trials , but moving into the future .
but if i take that same data , upload it to decodeme , i can look at my risk for sample type 2 diabetes .
how about more targeted therapies for cancer ?
we can now reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and to utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient -- making your own personalized stem cell lines .
i know now her life was hard ; she lost three children as babies , then her husband died too , leaving young sons , and no money .
her shadow once , fumbling the chain on her door , then the door slamming fearfully shut , only the barking and the music -- jazz -- filtering as it does , day and night into the hall .
my holding the door .
she boldly , unblinkingly , even pugnaciously , wrathfully even , when her bottle was empty .
forever . with grace .
but it was like sex , you didn &apos;t have to be told .
so let &apos;s begin with a group of images .
some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in iraq than virtually any other single act .
ansel adams said , and i &apos;m going to disagree with him , &quot; you don &apos;t take a photograph , you make it . &quot;
&quot; ben , i &apos;ve read somewhere that at minus 40 , exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute , so how do you answer the call of nature ? &quot;
we had less than two hours two-way communication with the outside world in two months .
two norwegians did it as a team in 2000 . no one &apos;s done it solo .
grand total in all , 95 days of food and fuel , 180 kilos -- that &apos;s almost exactly 400 pounds .
and this meant i could ski over very thin ice , and if i fell through , it wasn &apos;t the end of the world .
the only proof i &apos;ve got that i was there is a blurry photo of my gps , the little satellite navigation gadget .
this was the view outside my tent when i had this fateful phone call .
i thought , &quot; god , here we go . we &apos;re , we &apos;re -- this is all or nothing . &quot;
antarctica , if you include the ice shelves , is twice the size of australia -- it &apos;s a big place .
when i got back to his office , i wasn &apos;t really sure .
but let me give you a different perspective on the same story .
and that &apos;s a much , much more difficult lesson to take into account .
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong .
twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship .
our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel .
once in a while , our fears can predict the future .
read in the right way , our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of everyday clairvoyance , a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there &apos;s still time to influence how that future will play out .
that was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen .
but we found that these people in the street , all of them are our reporters , feeding our newsroom with pictures , with videos and with news .
in front of al jazeera , they started creating tribalism .
so we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world .
but this is a story -- it is a great story ; it is beautiful .
wadah khanfar : a historic moment in the arab world
and a small part of my brain is thinking , &apos; that is so gross and really dangerous , &apos; but most of my brain is thinking , &apos; please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me .
there &apos;s just kind of an ick factor there .
so what we &apos;ve been doing in the united states is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data .
and those groups are , globally , people who sell sex and their more regular partners .
now , funnily enough , this is also joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment .
and both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex -- and in drug users , you &apos;ve really got nothing much going on after treatment begins , and that &apos;s because of that alignment of incentives that i talked about earlier .
it &apos;s all politics .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie ! hey , hey , black-eyed susie !
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .
and you can look at more pictures .
you see , we &apos;d just been to the grocery store , and my mom refused to buy us the jar of ovaltine that had the coupon for the captain midnight decoder ring in it .
well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
it &apos;s usually played flat on your lap .
i just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues .
it had three chemicals we were really surprised to see : sulfur , potassium nitrate and charcoal .
it just flared up , and he turned around , and he looked like this .
three years later , we have the perimeter institute for theoretical physics in waterloo , ontario . it &apos;s the most exciting job i &apos;ve ever had .
so that is both aristotelian cosmology , and in a certain sense , medieval society .
so we call it a relational universe .
and if you push that all the way down , really , it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational .
every seven years , i close it for one year to pursue some little experiments , things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year .
in a career i &apos;m definitely more engaged .
and all the stuff i could afford , i didn &apos;t like .
and he has 2.2 million requests for reservations .
what came out of it ?
it works the same internally with the president or the musical director , whose casa da musica portraits wind up on their business cards .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
and i think she overdid it .
so this cultural complex surrounding death , the ritual enactment of the end of life , has made death the most visible and remarkable aspect of toraja &apos;s landscape .
this is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition in their relationship to the deceased , and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who &apos;s living to relating to the deceased as a person who &apos;s an ancestor .
but i know that my husband &apos;s family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives , when they can ritually recount his life &apos;s narrative , weaving his story into the history of their community .
so nice , all week . he &apos;s the kind of man you could say to , &quot; chris , i &apos;m really sorry , i &apos;ve crashed your car .
don &apos;t go through this . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
and there he is .
&quot; i just think , you know , what people forget , gordon and i , we always got on perfectly well .
and that &apos;s , you know , that &apos;s something -- and that &apos;s something we can relate to .
that &apos;s eight years of american history , eight minutes of my act , just gone like that .
do you remember that film with helen hunt and jack nicholson , and helen hunt says to jack nicholson , &quot; what do you see in me ? &quot;
&quot; ... who said , reach out and touch ... &quot;
none , huh ?
and that happened for all museums .
they &apos;re basically retaining their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny .
and if you cut into an older dinosaur , it &apos;s very massive .
and then there &apos;s this thing called dracorex , hogwart &apos;s eye .
so just with these three dinosaurs , you can easily -- as a scientist -- we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series of the same animal .
and the middle size one is really spongy .
so we look at the bone histology .
now as you can imagine , this is not very popular with fourth-graders .
it reads the shifting conditions of temperature , humidity , wind direction , wind speed , dew point , and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout .
anyway , it &apos;s a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed , and so it &apos;s now a memory of an apparition , actually , but it continues to live in edible form .
honeybee robotics designed the mars driller , and it was really very much fun to work with them .
then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall .
and we asked ourselves , why couldn &apos;t it be exhibitionistic , like the met , or like some of the other buildings at lincoln center ?
just everything is lined , it incorporates -- every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high-performance skin .
the paper apologized but said it never runs photos of women .
what emerges is a truly sad , horrific tale of a young girl and her family trapped in poverty .
manga girls .
but he did have one suggestion .
an event seen from one point of view gives one impression .
and it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants .
i went to the united nations as an ambassador , and it was after the gulf war , and i was an instructed ambassador .
and no guy ever gets criticized . but that &apos;s the least of it .
and therefore it means that we have to remember that , while many of us have had huge opportunities -- and pat , you have been a real leader in your field -- is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women .
do you believe , and can you tell us why , there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis ?
i think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office , to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices .
and they say , &quot; no , no , that &apos;s what it says here in our holy book . &quot;
it was fought for , it was campaigned for , it was innovated for .
and 2028 , 2030 ? it &apos;s just around the corner .
and right now , we know that the biggest disease of all is not a disease . it &apos;s corruption .
because as is obvious , factivists have feelings too .
but one , to me , that &apos;s most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development -- the output .
then you &apos;re going to have a compiler that &apos;s going to take that description and it &apos;s going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed .
so , this is normal dna , what you think of as normal dna .
and what happens is that we mix these strands together .
it &apos;s china , right ?
the fact is that it does not scale .
the counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing .
and you can see how they count .
so , i share it with all of you here today , though the idea itself is getting crystallized and i &apos;m still writing up the business plan .
with the significance being these funds have come in as a qt capital , not as grant or as philanthropy .
all she needed was permission to build three steps to her house , from ground level , making it easier for her to enter and exit her house .
shaffi mather : i just have to get through the initial days where i don &apos;t get eliminated .
thank you so much for sharing this idea at ted .
we &apos;ve got a bigger conversation about israel and palestine radiating outwards from the middle east .
we might just say , well , what are the most popular talks out there ?
so we &apos;re using these network motifs to find talks that are unique , ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields , ones that are central to their topic , and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields .
trained at a young age to capitalize , letters taught now that capitalism raises you but you have to step on someone else to get there .
and all of the items on it are unremarkable .
you need the time to get to know the people that you &apos;re serving .
but not so fast .
and would you pay them a bonus for being empathic ?
now , how about incentives ?
the truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough .
and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too .
there are ordinary heroes .
if you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill .
a few years ago i was visited by the guy that runs darpa , the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably wouldn &apos;t take the risk of doing .
so , they finished that . and i , as you can tell , am a bashful guy .
at the end of exactly one year we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom , all the sensors , all the microprocessors , all the stuff inside .
he &apos;s going to pick up a grape -- he didn &apos;t drop it , he didn &apos;t break it -- and he &apos;s going to eat it .
&quot; well , would it help if i ... &quot;
then we went out to brooke army medical center .
&quot; sure . &quot;
they were tough questions . there &apos;s polarized groups down there .
dean kamen : the emotion behind invention
the woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .
as a magician , i try to create images that make people stop and think .
his core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees .
so , i got my hands on that chemical , filled the sink up with it , and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in , which was really impossible .
you blow in and out ...
and i started to really adapt my body .
this was a different record . this was a pure o2 static apnea record that guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes .
so , i did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do .
i was just sitting there thinking , &quot; i &apos;ve got to slow this down .
my heartbeat would go from 120 , to 50 , to 150 , to 40 , to 20 , to 150 again .
and i think magic , whether i &apos;m holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards , is pretty simple .
mm : and that linking of the digital content to something that &apos;s physical is what we call an aura , and i &apos;ll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk .
move away from it and come back to it .
it &apos;s just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint , and the great thing is , if you &apos;re a professional user , -- so , a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical to what we &apos;ve just used to create this demonstration .
and if it will be , it &apos;s the right thing to do , and if not , rethink it . &quot;
what will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion in the next 30 years ?
let &apos;s go up and take a look at the himalayas .
but now let &apos;s look at the case for optimism .
six months ago , a group of business activists gathered together to join with the republican governor in california to pass ab 32 , the most far-reaching legislation in environmental history .
pharaoh ramses the fifth , whose picture is here , died of smallpox .
and that has been the second great -- couple 100,000 years , 150,000 years -- by changing our environment , we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve .
but these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology .
these are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow , green , red , and they are actually available now in certain states .
these are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species .
but it &apos;s the closest they can get to a landing .
and it &apos;s not just technology that we &apos;re putting into animals .
for the first time in the history of this planet , we are able to directly design organisms .
he was raised by very supportive and interested parents .
the toms 7 satellite data , shown here , show the annual average ultraviolet radiation at the earth &apos;s surface .
so melanin was recruited , in our lineage , and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in africa , to be a natural sunscreen .
here are just some of the biggest movements of people , voluntary movements , in the last 5,000 years .
evolution helps us .
take your skin color , and celebrate it .
now this is the real . it &apos;s a cauliflower .
this is very rough , and this is sort of smooth , and this perfectly smooth .
the bronchi branch , branch , branch and they stop branching , not because of any matter of principle , but because of physical considerations : the mucus , which is in the lung .
well , they do mix .
well , so i looked at these things called brownian motion -- just goes around .
where are real price increments ?
this shape is of an extraordinary complication .
well , let me finish .
which got me thinking .
and you know that .
less effort , you &apos;re less persistent , and so on .
it &apos;s not ambiguous ; you know if you &apos;ve solved the puzzles or not .
and what is happiness ?
the real question is , how can markets be developed in rural africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists ?
and that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals , and situations where there are deficits , for example .
africa has learned , or is learning somewhat slowly , that markets don &apos;t happen by themselves .
and over the last decade , you see that the share of western exchanges -- and this is the u.s. share of exchanges in the world -- has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade .
whereas before the farmer used to think local -- meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market , eight to 10 kilometers away on average , and sell whatever they happened to have , without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was -- now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market .
so we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers &apos; choices , to grow our agriculture , and to change africa .
but , moving mountains can be dangerous . let me try and explain why .
they had to move this village in 1987 as a huge dune threatened to swallow it .
so , the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us .
so , we have a way of turning sand into sandstone , and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes .
now , there are many details left to explore in this scheme -- political , practical , ethical , financial .
i realized that the truly appropriate , low-cost tools that i needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn &apos;t exist yet .
a greater distribution of the means of production , environmentally sound supply chains , and a newly relevant diy maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity .
he &apos;s barefoot . he &apos;ll run back into his house , and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet .
but i think that it &apos;s so good — it doesn &apos;t smell , we can put it in our house , we can lock it behind a door — and i think we &apos;ve locked it out of conversation too .
so these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in butare .
in india now there &apos;s a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don &apos;t have a toilet .
her entire life , she &apos;d been using the banana field behind , but she installed the latrine in a few hours .
it &apos;s 2013 , yet 2.5 billion people in the world have no access to a basic sanitary toilet . and when there &apos;s no loo , where do you poo ? in the street , probably near your water and food sources -- causing untold death and disease from contamination . get ready for a blunt , funny , powerful talk from journalist rose george about a once-unmentionable problem .
and within a few months after that sea urchin dying , the seaweed started to grow .
and they tasted really good .
it &apos;s very pretty , and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern mediterranean .
and that &apos;s retirement homes on the west coast of florida .
and the algae give the corals sugar , and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection .
as the surface of the ocean gets warmer , the water is lighter when it &apos;s warmer , it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over .
&quot; where is everybody ? &quot; asked fermi , and his colleagues had no answer .
within 12 hours , i was horribly sunburned , just like richard dreyfuss in the movie .
it was as though time had stopped .
they were both big fans , mother and daughter -- very unusual .
and so i sure am glad i did not slow down to talk to her .
close encounter four : the algarve , portugal , 1991 .
now , i did not speak portuguese .
and even though , i think you &apos;ll agree , it is probable that during the time she was away , she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone , i love her and wait for her still .
and i want to ask the question : how far and how fast would be have to move ?
and this , this is where it gets interesting , because it turns out that human beings have something of an appetite for novelty .
and almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies .
what is the objective ?
it is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human , recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect rembrandt &apos;s fragile altruist within .
and of course , this task has material dimensions .
while they &apos;re taking the podium away , just a quick question .
as the world faces recession , climate change , inequity and more , tim jackson delivers a piercing challenge to established economic principles , explaining how we might stop feeding the crises and start investing in our future .
i wasn &apos;t quite sure what i was looking at .
and the images were always completely unexpected in the end , because i could have a very specific image about how it would turn out , i could paint it to match that , but the moment that sheila laid back into the milk , everything would change .
it &apos;ll just bake your retinas .
and every single oil is different when it hits water .
i mean , we &apos;re angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else .
but in many ways , that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us .
here we are normally ; we &apos;re standing at the gas pump , and we &apos;re feeling kind of helpless .
and it &apos;s sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us .
now on the one hand , the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil , but on the other hand , the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work , generally in a fairly crummy car .
and we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry , which is at least 10 billion dollars a year , into something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute .
we need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules .
contestants also put themselves forward .
no small thing .
the glacier &apos;s gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake .
i swam as quickly as i could for the first hundred meters , and then i realized very , very quickly , i had a huge problem on my hands .
instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke .
i usually say to people , when they say , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
this one is a two-bit counter .
i thought about this in the sense that it &apos;s great to build in biological materials , but can we do similar things ?
well , it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme , that you can take a linear string , which is a convenient thing to copy , and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3d structure .
if it &apos;s elliptical , you can make an astigmatic lens .
and a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems , share the information and work on those things together .
and why do you want a 3,000-square-foot kite ?
so if we &apos;re seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet , we need to look somewhere else for the solution .
when you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesn &apos;t use any of them really , you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as 90 percent .
and in fact , even space itself is turning into a service .
i would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible , they &apos;re being done right now , and that it &apos;s a darn good thing .
for example , any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment . the kind of infraction today that would give you a fine , in those days would result in your tongue being cut out , your ears being cut off , you being blinded , a hand being chopped off and so on .
maybe i had better shoot him , before he shoots me , especially since , even if he doesn &apos;t want to kill me , he &apos;s probably worrying right now that i might kill him before he kills me . &quot; and so on .
i loved that talk . i think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of -- that you were talking about , that peter singer talks about , is also driven by , just by technology , by greater visibility of the other , and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller . i mean , is that also a grain of truth ?
it &apos;s not surprising , because only three percent of people in the drc use condoms .
amy lockwood : selling condoms in the congo
it &apos;s about the bathroom and the kitchen . if you have soap , water and food , you know , you can live long .
income per person . i can put that here .
because in fact , this is child labor . my son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this .
look at income distribution .
here you have sub-saharan africa , south asia , east asia , arab states , east europe , latin america , and oecd .
and it is u.s. government at its best , without advocacy , providing facts , that it &apos;s useful for the society .
and we used to say that it should fall four percent per year .
singapore had twice the child mortality of sweden .
and there are others who are extremely high .
we have seen it here in mozambique .
i &apos;ve got apparently 18 minutes to convince you that history has a direction , an arrow ; that in some fundamental sense , it &apos;s good ; that the arrow points to something positive .
impressive . and the rate of technological evolution speeds up , so a mere quarter of a century after this , you get this , ok .
social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential , so you get cities , you know , and you get all the non-zero-sum games you don &apos;t think about that are being played across the world .
and one reason is because of something i call the &quot; growing lethality of hatred . &quot;
it &apos;s when your welfare conduces to mine , that i decide , oh yeah , i &apos;m all in favor of your welfare . that &apos;s what &apos;s responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far , and i &apos;m saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes , and if people respond to it intelligently , we will see the development of tolerance and so on -- the norms that we need , you know .
there are people who worry about this , and in fact , i , myself , apparently , was denounced on national tv a couple of nights ago because of an op-ed i &apos;d written .
the g8 summit proposes that the solution to africa &apos;s problems should be a massive increase in aid , something akin to the marshall plan .
i want to say that it is important to recognize that africa has fundamental weaknesses .
does any one of you in the audience have that person ?
and because many of our governments are quite dictatorial , they need really to have the army clobber the opposition .
the mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success , generalize them , pour billions and trillions of dollars into them , and then spread them across the whole world , ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village , the skills , the practices , the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed -- like in sauri village , in kenya , where jeffrey sachs is working -- and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody .
and let me show you , what does public expenditure -- rather , public administration expenditure -- in uganda constitute ?
and she said , &quot; well , one . &quot;
and the other thing that happened is that a science developed , a science of mental illness .
it should be interested in the best things in life .
that is , which ones actually make people lastingly happier ?
but in the third great arena of life , love , len is an abysmal failure .
just one example . one person i worked with was a bagger at genuardi &apos;s .
the person has to be alive . ok .
conversely , if you have none of the three , the empty life , the sum is less than the parts .
and if design can increase positive emotion , eudaimonia , and flow and meaning , what we &apos;re all doing together will become good enough . thank you .
and this is a comet , captured by dr. euan mason .
and it has become a wild success , tapping into the enthusiast photography community .
it was with the elephants that this story pivoted .
so instead , what we did was we decided to , instead of going out and doing what would result in what we &apos;d consider sort of a survey story -- where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything -- we put jonas into dharavi , which is part of mumbai , india , and let him stay there , and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city .
jim started in the battlefield .
she &apos;s probably -- it &apos;s a shame you can &apos;t see it in the photograph , but she &apos;s 12 feet long .
one of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real , digital human face .
and , even more importantly , since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture , we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon , in many different facial poses and facial expressions .
we can turn the volume up a little bit if that &apos;s available .
and my father was a soldier , and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher .
that is a forest giraffe .
they were killing people . they were doing whatever they want because they have power .
he has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest .
and there was no way to work .
i had only this equipment -- my satellite phone , my computer and a plastic solar panel -- that i hide it in the forest .
we have a zoo of 14 okapis , and one of them was pregnant .
i don &apos;t know where to start , where to finish it .
i did it myself .
in many theme parks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line .
and so the marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality and its social and civic consequence .
who will get our discussion started ? yes ?
will they have learned that reading is a chore , a form of piecework to be done for pay , that &apos;s the worry , or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake ?
what matters is that people of different social backgrounds and different walks of life encounter one another , bump up against one another in the ordinary course of life , because this is what teaches us to negotiate and to abide our differences .
the white line is for the u.k. , and then the u.s .
the first headwind is demographics .
if you wanted to read in 1875 at night , you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp .
back before the turn of the century , women had another problem .
hurricane sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century , maybe for a couple of days , in some cases for more than a week , electricity , running water , heating , gasoline for their cars , and a charge for their iphones .
i do have to say , somebody -- i read recently that van gogh wasn &apos;t really necessarily psychotic , that he might have had temporal lobe seizures , and that might have caused his spurt of creativity , and i don &apos;t -- i suppose it does something in some part of your brain .
and one of the reasons , she thought , was that her mother , who had died when she was very young , was angry at her .
and this happens constantly in the writing .
but , both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning , or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions .
why or why not ?
and i took down this book , and i -- first page that i flipped it to was exactly the setting , and the time period , and the kind of character i needed -- was the taiping rebellion , happening in the area near guilin , outside of that , and a character who thought he was the son of god .
and as i said , my mother did not believe in randomness .
it is in the hands of readers , and they interpret it differently .
before i can do that i &apos;ve got to tell you about sliced bread , and a guy named otto rohwedder .
well , this tv-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours .
the world revolves around me . me , me , me , me , me . my favorite person -- me .
two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail -- one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box , and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them .
but market to these people because they care .
so when steve jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote , right , who are all tuned in from 130 countries watching his two-hour commercial -- that &apos;s the only thing keeping his company in business -- is that those 50,000 people care desperately enough to watch a two-hour commercial , and then tell their friends .
a couple of quick rules to wrap up .
who is going to raise their hand and say , &quot; i want to hear what you &apos;re doing next , &quot; and sell something to them .
nine months later i found myself spraying messages in tahrir square . the reason for this act was this image that i saw in my newsfeed .
i found neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in tahrir , and i decided to take a no of mamluk mausoleum in cairo .
scarce labor drives wages .
and i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater , incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors .
and it received quite a bit of attention .
and it &apos;s destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom , things like sponges and corals , that critical habitat for other animals .
it &apos;s a very solitary creature .
and today , they crawl out and see condominiums .
and the other problem is they get hit by ships .
little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color .
it &apos;s horrible . it &apos;s a proof of our failing to save them in the wild .
this was like a biological desert .
you formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control , whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice .
may .
and if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil , and we were actually monitoring , measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares , 5,000 acres .
in the beginning , maybe pineapples and beans and corn ; in the second phase , there will be bananas and papayas ; later on , there will be chocolate and chilies .
this nearby city of balikpapan has a big problem with water ; it &apos;s 80 percent surrounded by seawater , and we have now a lot of intrusion there .
so now we do the monitoring on the inside -- from towers , satellites , ultralights .
willie smits : how to restore a rainforest
this is very early rehearsal footage , but the finished work &apos;s on tour and is actually coming through l.a. in a couple weeks .
rm : well some of them definitely have a direct observation -- like literally two raindrops falling , and just watching that pattern is so stunning .
i &apos;m working in cities for almost 40 years , and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big , or the other mayors say , &quot; we don &apos;t have financial resources , &quot; i would like to say from the experience i had : every city in the world can be improved in less than three years .
so , this system started in &apos; 74 . we started with 25,000 passengers a day , now it &apos;s 2,200,000 passengers a day .
and before you say it &apos;s a norman foster design , we designed this in &apos; 83 .
and since we have people from uzbekistan , kazakhstan , tajikistan , &#91; unclear &#93; , we have to stop the program .
why consciousness ?
either it doesn &apos;t exist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some damn fool thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science .
now , i haven &apos;t yet given you a definition .
you see , the distinction between reality and illusion is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are .
now , think of what i told you .
i add two plus two to get four .
you &apos;re giving up on 300 years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it .
i have one climate crisis ; i don &apos;t really need the second one . &quot;
you have to go looking for them , they &apos;re not just lying around on the surface .
we must disenthrall ourselves , and then we shall save our country . &quot;
my daughter never wears a watch , my daughter kate , who &apos;s 20 .
he said , &quot; always . i &apos;ve always been a fireman . &quot;
they &apos;re three .
often , people are good at things they don &apos;t really care for .
or at home , if that &apos;s where they choose to be educated with their families or their friends .
so erez and i wanted to know more about that .
and so that explains this pattern that we &apos;ve seen before .
and i said , &quot; kids are getting killed there .
that means i need to know how i tick , when i collapse , where my formidable points are , where my weaker points are .
how can this be made better ?
and it brings me to the crux of what &apos;s going on , or what i perceive as going on , in the world today , which is that last century was top-down power .
and complete silence fell .
we can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known .
it is endless .
you can see i don &apos;t do much . i &apos;m just standing there , again with my eyes closed , and other people are molding me , evidential .
this is a work called &quot; room for the great australian desert . &quot;
as john cage said , &quot; we are not moving towards some kind of goal .
asked later in the canadian documentary , &quot; the corporation , &quot; what i meant by the &quot; go to jail &quot; remark , i offered that theft is a crime .
we have measured our progress very rigorously .
and this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found mission zero to be incredibly good for business .
but what if we reframed ehrlich further ?
here is what glenn wrote . and here is that person , most at risk .
while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems , we now realize that the internet is , if anything , too effective in that regard .
both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion , internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models .
today &apos;s dance world is not defined solely by the royal winnipeg ballet or the national ballet of canada , but by liz lerman &apos;s dance exchange -- a multi-generational , professional dance company , whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 , and who work with genomic scientists to embody the dna strand and with nuclear physicists at cern .
what you just heard is &quot; skylife &quot; by david balakrishnan .
and so for the remaining two years of my high school , i cut all my classes .
as you can see , it has a fountain in the courtyard .
you don &apos;t need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids .
because the students made puff pastry and that &apos;s what the school ate every day .
the kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago -- he &apos;s now an instructor .
we teach photography .
and it &apos;s worked out pretty good up to this day .
i said , &quot; you &apos;re the gift . &quot;
and pat metheny and jim hall were there and they recorded with us .
so , the hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city .
and now i really want to build one . &quot;
and so i stood up in front of 200 very angry , very disappointed people on a summer night , and the air conditioner had broken and it was 100 degrees outside , and i started showing these pictures .
it &apos;s 40,000 dollars to build the university of pittsburgh medical school .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about today is a device that we &apos;ve been working on that i think has the potential to make a difference , to be much more effective , and what i wanted to do is show you how it works . okay , so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve .
in other words , we &apos;re not literally replacing the components of the retina .
but there was this limiting factor , the issue of the code , and how to make the cells respond better , produce normal responses , and so this was our contribution .
at the best , you &apos;re 10 percent human , but more likely about one percent human , depending on which of these metrics you like .
the question that we had is how can bacteria , these primitive organisms , tell the difference from times when they &apos;re alone , and times when they &apos;re in a community , and then all do something together .
and as the day goes by the bacteria double , they release the molecule , and then light comes on at night , exactly when the squid wants it .
what i hope you can see is that the molecules are related .
it &apos;s a very small , five-carbon molecule .
we &apos;ve taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we &apos;ve made antagonists of the interspecies communication system .
this is exactly what happens in your body .
i have a suggestion .
how many say the best flute players ?
let &apos;s take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice .
all right , those of you , i imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage .
charley : i &apos;ll stick to my original thesis .
he said it &apos;s not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf .
and how many favor the second , same-sex marriage ?
and i think we can do that in public life more generally .
that was easy . ok .
are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ?
so that &apos;s all i &apos;m going to say about that .
there are two sorts of technological progress really , for this purpose .
so this is a genuine conclusion that i come to , that the first 150-year-old -- we don &apos;t know how old that person is today , because we don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s going to take to get these first-generation therapies .
so they &apos;ll probably think it &apos;s five years away .
if we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging , we will be here all night , because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another .
and of course the main thing is that you shouldn &apos;t trust people who call themselves gerontologists because , as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field , you know , you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously .
so , to the extent that evolution doesn &apos;t matter , doesn &apos;t care whether genes are passed on by individuals , living a long time or by procreation , there &apos;s a certain amount of modulation of that , which is why different species have different lifespans , but that &apos;s why there are no immortal species .
first , of course , the economic meltdown .
we believe that you should always understand the risks that you &apos;re taking , and we will not invest in things we don &apos;t understand .
so i guess the world is insane , because i see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again , hoping that this time it &apos;s not going to collapse upon us .
we need to start embracing the beauty of balance .
and probably the best example we have here in america is portland , oregon .
according to the center for disease control , fully one third of all children born after 2000 will get diabetes .
and then finally , in terms of driving , there &apos;s the issue of the single-largest killer of healthy adults , and one of the largest killers of all people , is car crashes .
and then the american environmental movement has been a classically arcadian movement .
we &apos;ve changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers , and you should do the same thing , but changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week .
the other one is the lazarus project , and that &apos;s focused on the gastric brooding frog .
he was the last person who had this frog , a colony of these things , in his lab .
we haven &apos;t done it yet , but keep those applause ready .
that similarity meant they probably competed .
and i thought , when i became director of the australian museum , i &apos;m going to give this a go .
does it have to stay in a laboratory , or could we put it back where it belongs ?
this particular one came in out of the forest to lick this boy and curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep . a wild animal .
external debt -- something that i can tell you a long story about because i personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent -- has come down dramatically .
there is no way you can know what people want .
so i &apos;m afraid we &apos;ve been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate .
at a certain point in time , in 1969 , things were really bad .
and while they were trying to break down the door , i climbed in through the window , and jumped in .
that &apos;s why i said the debate has to get more sophisticated .
but i &apos;m not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way .
each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best .
if you tell them , &quot; we need a road here , &quot; they will help you build it .
so i &apos;m saying that one of the takeaways from here -- i &apos;m not saying the men are not important -- obviously , if you leave the husbands out , what will they do ?
and this video is a video of keith jarrett , who &apos;s a well-known jazz improviser and probably the most well-known , iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a really higher level .
i think that neuroscientists have many more questions than answers , and i myself , i &apos;m not going to give you many answers today , just ask a lot of questions .
you can &apos;t just sort of -- &quot; it &apos;s great we &apos;ve got this keyboard . &quot;
they do a whole host of things that have to do with self-reflection , introspection , working memory and so forth .
that was challenging .
so i told my lab members that i would rap for ted , and they said , &quot; no , you won &apos;t . &quot;
you have heightened brain activity when you &apos;re doing a comparable task , when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized .
but if it &apos;s taught properly , it can be a lot of fun .
there is no longer any consistency in the surface signals .
it takes eight seconds to do this , and now that that &apos;s done , we can choose a movement-based action .
tl : but we can see that it actually works , even though you can only hold it for a little bit of time .
we invent .
they have incredible insulation , so let &apos;s put some incredible insulation here .
and bed nets have an effect on the epidemic , but you &apos;re never going to make it extinct with bed nets .
and using both this technique and other optical techniques , we think we can make those diagnostics .
and then , of course , the next year it comes roaring back .
now , just suspend disbelief for a moment , and let &apos;s think of what could happen if we could do that .
and we &apos;re going to show you , instead of the kill laser , which will be a very brief , instantaneous pulse , we &apos;re going to have a green laser pointer that &apos;s going to stay on the mosquito for , actually , quite a long period of time ; otherwise , you can &apos;t see it very well .
i mean , here we &apos;re blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down .
this is the restaurant , acorn house .
here &apos;s a great little example .
this takes the water out of the restaurant , runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there -- and i sort of water the garden with it .
he &apos;s growing all his own fruit , and that &apos;s fantastic .
everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning , and that &apos;s been something that &apos;s been nurturing me for some time , and it &apos;s an important statement to understand .
and something that i realized early on in the project was that if i wasn &apos;t doing anything interesting , i would probably forget to record the video .
or we &apos;re , &quot; oh , yeah , this party , let me take a picture . &quot;
eventually , these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches .
these are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way .
in fact , it is a step counter , and it counts the steps .
could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level ?
and you should know that basically 99 , probably 99 percent plus of our experiments failed .
so last fall when we published the results of that work in science , we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast .
so , there are four major watermarks all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code .
we actually view it as a baby step in terms of , it &apos;s taken us 15 years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do 15 years ago on understanding life at its basic level .
yet the fact that so few people do actually read the koran is precisely why it &apos;s so easy to quote -- that is , to misquote .
so the koran in english is a kind of shadow of itself , or as arthur arberry called his version , &quot; an interpretation . &quot;
there are no 72 virgins in the koran .
and these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds .
they go out , they get the food , they dig the nest , and the queen never comes out again .
when extra food becomes available -- and this is what everybody knows about picnics -- then extra ants are allocated to collect the food .
there &apos;s the larvae , and they consume most of the food .
does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing ? &quot;
the patrollers become foragers .
so anybody who &apos;s ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae .
and the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip , are contacting the ants coming in .
but my subject is national security .
we are policing the world , and how are we doing that ?
and when you look at what we &apos;re using the oil for , 70 percent of it is used for transportation fuel .
it &apos;s ours , we have an abundance of it .
that &apos;s your concern .
in a nutshell that &apos;s what happened ?
no , no . the argument that it &apos;s a bridge fuel makes sense , because the amount of co2 per unit of energy is lower than oil and coal , correct ?
and i can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be .
now the largest aquifer in north america is from midland , texas to the south dakota border , across eight states -- big aquifer : ogallala , triassic age .
tbp : i lost 150 million on the wind , okay .
but you had the same thing with the gold rush . &quot; gold . gold . gold . &quot;
the san francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon to go search for gold .
bride # 2 : then why does she have my invitation ?
the killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb .
this is the first vacuum cleaner , the 1905 skinner vacuum , from the hoover company . and this one weighed 92 pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car .
everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines .
i took this picture just two days ago .
1998 : &quot; amazon.toast. &quot; in 1999 : &quot; amazon.bomb. &quot;
ok so , a quick natural history , first of compassion .
so , it &apos;s another good news / bad news story .
the israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them , but they impose one on gaza , and they say , &quot; well , the palestinians , or some of them , have brought this on themselves . &quot;
and in real life , there are lots of non-zero-sum games .
and , you know , i &apos;m happy to say , i think there &apos;s really evidence that this non-zero-sum kind of connection can expand the moral compass .
this is not the same as compassion , but it &apos;s conducive to compassion . it opens the channels for compassion .
in oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named alice stewart .
conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that george could give alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right .
eighty-five percent is a really big number .
and when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn &apos;t make sense .
why not ?
and many of you know how it looks , except that inside that breast , there are all these pretty , developing , tree-like structures .
all right . and here is this beautiful human cell , and you can imagine that here also , context goes .
we &apos;d like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic .
so the cell acts like an embryo . what an exciting thing .
mina bissell : experiments that point to a new understanding of cancer
you may think that &apos;s a weapon right there . in fact , that &apos;s a stamp . i used a stamp to defend canada &apos;s borders .
now , the sock puppet , on the other hand , is a totally different animal . the sock puppet isn &apos;t about ambiguity , per se . it &apos;s about identity .
and it really throws people for a loop because we think , well , there &apos;s no nonverbal cues , so why don &apos;t you lie more ?
now , as you see , most of the little dots are below the line .
so there are some pathological liars , but they make up a tiny portion of the population . we lie for a reason .
now , your task now is to decide which review is fake ?
we believe that every lie now , every type of lie -- fake hotel reviews , fake shoe reviews , your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging -- those are all different lies . they &apos;re going to have different patterns of language . but because everything &apos;s recorded now , we can look at all of those kinds of lies .
right there . okay , glass , take a picture .
they were all wearing glass , and that &apos;s how we got that footage .
i would just light up a cigarette . it would look cooler .
i don &apos;t know where inspiration comes from .
i want to show you -- i &apos;m also like a big -- i go to astrologers and tarot card readers often , and that &apos;s another thing that motivates me a lot .
that &apos;s the name of the show , they eat out , they -- that &apos;s on my tombstone when i die .
i started making puppets when i was a kid .
this is one of my favorite clips of rosie .
rod : no , but it means that your priority has to be their well-being first , i think .
like i say , oh , you know , would you serve a rotten chicken ?
chef : oh , you don &apos;t know ? let me tell you something .
isaac mizrahi : fashion and creativity
if we look at islamists , if we look at the phenomenon of far-right fascists , one thing they &apos;ve been very good at , one thing that they &apos;ve actually been exceeding in , is communicating across borders , using technologies to organize themselves , to propagate their message and to create truly global phenomena .
but even if you look across the mood music in europe of late , far-right fascism is also on the rise .
again with the example of the far right : that we find , ironically , xenophobic nationalists are utilizing the benefits of globalization .
why is it that extremist organizations , whether of the far-right or of the islamist extremism -- islamism meaning those who wish to impose one version of islam over the rest of society -- why is it that they are succeeding in organizing in a globalized way , whereas those who aspire to democratic culture are falling behind ?
well statistically , the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated .
now to conclude , how does that happen ?
you probably read something about it in the papers .
but there is a curious asymmetry here .
it &apos;s still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the internet well .
this was an incredible , coordinated global response .
and in fact that is happening this week .
we saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the obama campaign .
media , the media landscape that we knew , as familiar as it was , as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs , is increasingly slipping away .
you can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour .
you want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen .
everybody &apos;s on oxygen , your supplies are limited , and you either have to go up or go down , make that decision very quickly .
this is a picture of me in that area taken a year before , and you can see i &apos;ve got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather .
we also got some bad news in the storm that beck weathers , another climber , had collapsed in the snow and was dead .
the ones that weren &apos;t that lucid or were not that well coordinated , i would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain .
what we did was try to warm them up as best we could , put oxygen on them and try to revive them , which is difficult to do at 21,000 feet , when the tent is freezing .
and beck told me that story very quietly , but i was absolutely stunned by it .
he &apos;s dying .
it just shows you what the power of the mind can do .
in the 1980s we had the reagan revolution , which lead to deregulation .
and this is very important . at the same time if you peel away the demographic dividend in india , there are actually two demographic curves .
twenty years back , when there was a report on bank computerization , they didn &apos;t name the report as a report on computers , they call them as &quot; ledger posting machines . &quot;
so there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work .
increasingly now the policies of taxation and infrastructure and all that , are moving towards creating india as a single market .
as a result of that our higher education is simply not keeping pace with india &apos;s demands .
now why does this matter to you ?
secondly , a political theorist who &apos;s going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about .
democracy is the only game in town .
and you have the internet .
so this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore .
this is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent .
five great revolutions have shaped political culture over the past 50 years , says theorist ivan krastev . he shows how each step forward -- from the cultural revolution of the &apos; 60s to recent revelations in the field of neuroscience -- has also helped erode trust in the tools of democracy . as he says , &quot; what went right is also what went wrong . &quot; can democracy survive ?
and here &apos;s the opportunity .
only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level of five gcses at 16 , against 58 percent of the wider population .
because normal contracting for things , when you &apos;re spending government money , you &apos;re spending our money , tax money , and the people who are in charge of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it .
this is like -- it feels like the united nations just here .
any lebanese by applause ? lebanese .
every country — iranians , sometimes we do two , sometimes we do three .
but now apparently we can &apos;t even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane .
if you guys haven &apos;t figured it out already , my name &apos;s tom thum , and i &apos;m a beatboxer , which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice , and the only thing was my voice .
i got way too much time on my hands .
decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing .
you probably had no idea . it &apos;s like driving around the world six times .
and i hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom .
but you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain , noninvasively , with focused ultrasound in the &apos; 50s .
and the objective of that ?
and you see the temperature rises to like 55 to 60 degrees c .
he &apos;s back to his normal life .
but now , you ask me , but what about war , the war on cancer ?
all those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods , abdominal pressure , back pain , frequent urination .
she &apos;s looking at the seams . she &apos;s looking at the construction .
we think of it as maybe too silly , too unnecessary .
when you look at copies like this , you wonder : how do the luxury high-end brands remain in business ?
now of course , there &apos;s a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process .
they knock themselves off .
you know , it &apos;s not just the fashion industry that doesn &apos;t have copyright protection .
i want a picture . &quot; and the lawyers do not provide a picture , so i made one .
and my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future .
so what you &apos;re looking at here is the rhizocarpon geographicum , or map lichen , and this is around 3,000 years old and lives in greenland , which is a long way to go for some lichens .
and i had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one .
and then , you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern iceland that reached 405 years old .
so his thought was that flooding in the north of africa actually brought those coniferous trees down tens of thousands of years ago , and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation to this unique desert environment .
and what that means is that it &apos;s not dormant -- it &apos;s actually been living and growing for half a million years .
so , every popcorn production begins with the video , and so i &apos;ve made a short , 20-second clip using a newscaster template that we use in workshops .
i think popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on the web , and the way we understand the world we live in .
technology has made our world increasingly open , and for the most part , that &apos;s great , but all of this openness may have unintended consequences .
of course , the terrorists knew that no indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the taj .
you see , you can now commit more crime as well .
we know with them that you can print in many materials ranging from plastic to chocolate to metal and even concrete .
the defibrillators allow a physician at a distance to give a shock to a heart in case a patient needs it .
engineers , by moving around a small number of genetic changes , were able to weaponize it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch , so that not thousands of people would die , but tens of millions .
we &apos;ve already seen examples of this working well .
on the one hand , people say , &quot; the time for change is now . &quot;
i &apos;ve been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion .
and what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure .
he said , &quot; we used to feel like nobodies , but now we feel like somebodies . &quot;
but less than 24 hours , i was 13 miles away from those mosques , visiting one of our acumen investees , an incredible man , jawad aslam , who dares to live a life of immersion .
and he tells this incredible story about working with a little six-year-old girl named ruby bridges , the first child to desegregate schools in the south -- in this case , new orleans .
and it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written .
so let &apos;s try to find them .
there is no reason why these portraits should look alike .
it makes me to stand here , the fame , the money i got out of it .
why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife ?
that makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect . that five days i &apos;ll never forget -- the messy days , the lousy days , that wetness .
now i &apos;m on my seventh year sustaining against multinational , transnational giants -- makes all mba students a question mark .
not in front pocket . i &apos;m a back pocket man .
he also told me about the great explorers .
fresh water freezes at zero .
i could barely breathe . i was gasping for air .
he accidentally fell through the ice into the sea .
and then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor , which measures my core body temperature and my heart rate .
lp : thank you very much . thank you very much .
ladies and gentlemen , thank you very , very much .
there was one kind of peak oil in 1985 , when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply .
and it &apos;s just limestone , nothing really special about it .
and i &apos;ll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk .
that was easy , but then i made the decision , maybe arbitrary , that they needed to be people of a certain age , which at that point , when i created this program , seemed really old .
by the way , this was always done in public .
these were people through their 90s .
all of us are public and private beings , and if all you &apos;re going to get from the interviewee is their public self , there &apos;s no point in it .
anything that i would ask , she would turn around , dismiss , and i was basically up there -- any of you in the moderate-to-full entertainment world know what it is to die onstage .
everybody came . the butler passed around canapes .
and i asked him one question .
she wasn &apos;t about to make up for this occasion .
marc pachter has conducted live interviews with some of the most intriguing characters in recent american history as part of a remarkable series created for the smithsonian &apos;s national portrait gallery . he reveals the secret to a great interview and shares extraordinary stories of talking with steve martin , clare booth luce and more .
we killed thousands of post-it notes .
it turns out they &apos;ve got to fish where the fish are .
so it &apos;s over the baby , illuminating a single patient .
turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like .
i had a laptop in the peace corps , and the screen had all these dead pixels on it .
because there is this asymmetry , which creates , basically , failing governance .
we are not talking about 50,000 dollars here , or 100,000 dollars there , or one million dollars there .
in 1997 , a convention , under the auspices of the oecd , which obliged everybody to change their laws and criminalize foreign bribery .
in germany , we are pushing the ratification of the un convention , which is a subsequent convention .
i &apos;m going to tell you about an affliction i suffer from .
i choose a painting . it might just be one painting in 50 .
i can do whatever i want , i can come up with whatever story i want to .
he has her wear very plain clothes .
he &apos;s absolutely balanced between innocence and experience , and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting .
he &apos;s not happy , and why isn &apos;t he happy ?
i knew even before i stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed .
&quot; congratulations on your upcoming nuptials , james .
and so i think i have to tell you just a few words , a few things about my personal life , because i think there is a connection .
and he had nine days to make it .
you still have to report the incident .
he influences you really good , you know .
kbi : i &apos;m just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won &apos;t affect my face -- the explosion , you know .
and guess what ?
toyin alousa : nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them .
and these aren &apos;t films that are primarily seen in cinemas ?
or , i go to a show and i see a beautiful piece by an artist , particularly beautiful , i say he &apos;s so good because he clearly looked to design to understand what he needed to do .
and does it matter ? &quot; thank you . does it matter ?
and it &apos;s fantastic .
or , you know , vib-ribbon was not distributed here in the united states .
but we don &apos;t have gta because , maybe it &apos;s my own reflection , i &apos;ve never been able to do anything but crashing cars and shooting prostitutes and pimps .
the real core issue of interaction design is behavior .
so in a way , we &apos;re showing a manifestation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have .
and then i did a law school for loyola in downtown l.a .
and they started to have a life of their own and got bigger -- as the one glass at the walker .
as for craft and technology and all those things that you &apos;ve all been talking about , i was thrown for a complete loop .
and we &apos;ve started to work on things .
and then we did a camp together for children with cancer .
the metalworkers , for the most part , do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff .
he would send me a fax and show me something .
and then more metal and some chain link in santa monica -- a little shopping center .
he didn &apos;t recommend me , by the way .
we collaborated with oldenburg and put the newspaper on top , folded .
and it &apos;s very private .
and you feel like you &apos;re in your own kind of village .
these are the models for it .
but it &apos;s the living room .
and from the building in the back , you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills .
actually , this is the smallest hall in size , and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies .
it &apos;s a public space , and i made it kind of a garden structure , and you can go in it .
it &apos;s a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world .
and the idea was that you could take waste paper ; you could compress it ; and make briquettes that could be used for fuel .
and conveniently , one of my students was from ghana , and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called &quot; kokonte , &quot; which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root .
and after some time , we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal , which actually now burns longer , cleaner than wood charcoal .
they can generate income from this .
we need to work with the people in these communities , and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems . that &apos;s the best way to do it .
and this bone is peppered , as you can see , with the light shining through the skull with cavities , the sinuses , which warm and moisten the air we breathe .
here &apos;s a classic example : rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that &apos;s growing out through her skull , has obliterated her nose , and she &apos;s having difficulty seeing .
i &apos;d like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward .
henry taught me that you can carry on working .
when they have facial surgery , they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people .
he said you could see criminal faces , judging them just on the photographs that were showed .
this is what ann wants . she wants to be out kayaking , she wants to be out climbing mountains .
what does that mean ?
i &apos;m the director of nutrition services for the berkeley unified school district . i have 90 employees and 17 locations , 9,600 kids .
and clearly , with what &apos;s going on with fossil fuel usage , or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away , as oil hits its peak oil , you know , we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should , or could , be moving food 1,500 miles before we eat it .
that &apos;s what i really try and get people to understand .
you know , we are responsible for what kids eat .
in case you can &apos;t tell , that &apos;s , like , pink danish and some kind of cupcakes .
we can &apos;t keep serving kids processed crap , full of chemicals , and expect these are going to be healthy citizens .
and why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation , maybe two , of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food , one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a tv or computer .
in our school district , the way we afford this is our school district allocates .03 percent of the general fund towards nutrition services . and i think if every school district allocated a half to one percent , we could start to really fix this program .
i think if we &apos;re going to fix this , one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the national school lunch program .
it &apos;s the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can &apos;t even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food .
they can grow so big , blocking all daylight , making it very dark and ominous standing under them .
and he says , &quot; it seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion , and if they don &apos;t accept the conclusion , they die .
it &apos;s a saul steinberg of course -- it was a new yorker cover .
don &apos;t tell me the answer . &quot;
it &apos;s a feature-length documentary on consciousness .
and i noticed that on the bridge there , there &apos;s a lot of people -- you can just barely see them walking across the bridge .
how many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind &apos;s eye , to see if it matched up with the one on the right ?
because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
so , show the original picture for 240 milliseconds . blank .
how many still don &apos;t see it ? how many still don &apos;t see it ?
anyway , the american cities : lots of roads dispersed over large areas , almost no public transportation .
and then someone came up with the idea that , apart from good public transport , apart from spending money on roads , let &apos;s try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks .
this is the last day with the congestion charges , july 31 , and you see the same street but now it &apos;s summer , and summer in stockholm is a very nice and light time of the year , and the first day without the congestion charges looked like this .
and after analyzing the answers , it turned out that more than half of them believe that they haven &apos;t changed their minds .
but he gave me a cup of tea .
it &apos;s an amazing thing that we &apos;re here to talk about the year of patients rising .
here , just for historical authenticity , is a picture of me in that year .
he said , &quot; your shoulder &apos;s going to be fine , but dave , there &apos;s something in your lung . &quot;
one was growing out the back , and it attached to the soleus muscle , which is a big muscle in the back that i &apos;d never heard of , but all of a sudden i cared about it .
and this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug i eventually got .
how amazing is that ?
and this is what we &apos;re doing when we make health care better .
so you can click on things and remove it .
he said , &quot; if you don &apos;t want to follow my instructions , go away . &quot;
and this attracts metals from their local environment .
damian palin : mining minerals from seawater
indeed , they do look very strange . we &apos;re humans .
and indeed , in this image , you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five bats .
and one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases , or does this variation just make you different ?
in europe alone , by 2050 , there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65 , and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80 .
so tonight , when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies , and you see this beautiful flying mammal , i want you to smile . thank you .
it wasn &apos;t just compassion for europe , though there was that .
is that easier or harder ?
and how about the long run ?
maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy .
you know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment , how they &apos;ve been sold over the last 40 years ?
however , i have to say , the process of communication does not come naturally to me .
so let &apos;s see what it looks like .
it &apos;s hard .
we need to employ technology to assist us in this quest .
i need to have a health care lexicon .
this is how you hold the needle .
promising to give exhibitions of paintings , i shipped my paints and arrived in mahabalipuram .
so we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
i read about the recent earthquake in chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean .
thank you .
and together they only form about 15 years of supply .
we will be able to fly into the anatomy of peter &apos;s brain -- literally , fly into his body -- but more importantly , we can look into his mind .
this is not &quot; the matrix . &quot; you can only do this to yourself . you take control .
why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
so , what i &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts -- to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
the concept of physical health is undefined .
the fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
in fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
i wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
i &apos;ve lived in the muslim world , spoken with a lot of muslim women .
it &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus .
what damage &#91; does &#93; it actually inflict on the plant ?
here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus , sooty mold , which is covering it .
and here comes the natural enemy , minute pirate bug , &quot; minute &quot; because it is rather small .
on the contrary , because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals .
finally , i want to get actually to my vision , or in fact , to my dream .
this was one of a series called &quot; zany afternoons , &quot; which became a book .
the auto-gyro couldn &apos;t wait for the invention of the helicopter , but it should have -- it wasn &apos;t a big success .
and i love cigars -- there &apos;s a cigar billboard down there .
this is the word side of my brain .
i think all of us have been interested , at one time or another , in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed , such as the classic maya in the yucatan , the easter islanders , the anasazi , fertile crescent society , angor wat , great zimbabwe and so on . and within the last decade or two , archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems underlying many of these past collapses .
third thing on my checklist : relations with friendlies that can sustain the society . in montana today , more than half of the income of montana is not earned within montana , but is derived from out of state : transfer payments from social security , investments and so on -- which makes montana vulnerable to the rest of the united states .
but today , their commitment to a british identity is serving australians poorly in their need to adapt to their situation in asia . so it &apos;s particularly difficult to change course when the things that get you in trouble are the things that are also the source of your strength .
there &apos;s a few hundreds of mammals -- six million species of insects .
and here you see me in a small , provincial town in china , lijiang -- about two million inhabitants .
in a lot of food items that we have -- i have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or , if you like , campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye .
in china in the last 20 years , it increased from 20 to 50 , and it &apos;s still increasing .
we &apos;re not taking the bonus yet .
we can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests , but there &apos;s a limitation very soon .
so we have to get used to the idea of eating insects .
marcel dicke : why not eat insects ?
finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year .
so no , suddenly i wasn &apos;t averse to butting any geezer off the list .
now , word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line .
so , the different parts of the astrolabe , in this particular type , the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars .
and so , this astrolabe is on loan from us from the oxford school of -- museum of history .
so , it &apos;s about 26 degrees . you can &apos;t see it from over there .
you can survey with it . the city of baghdad was surveyed with it .
every technology is transformed and moved by others .
it flips its body 180 degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall .
it stands for intelligent mobility platform with actuated spoke system .
so , this is climber .
this robot is a very recent project . it &apos;s called raphael .
now , this robot is currently our star robot .
it &apos;s a true actual goal . it &apos;s a very ambitious goal , but we truly believe that we can do it .
we also have the world &apos;s very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind .
at our lab romela , the robotics and mechanisms laboratory , we have these fantastic brainstorming sessions .
also , it &apos;s not about that , only about that . you also have to work really , really hard .
it &apos;s the hollowing out of small towns .
and this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class , and you can see the difference is pretty stark .
we had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we &apos;re able to do in a rural place like bertie county , that , as designers and builders , you can &apos;t do everywhere .
every time he has visitors , it &apos;s the first place that he takes them .
it asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community &apos;s development .
she is 15 years old .
we need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter , we need to work outside of our comfort zones more , and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard .
the next day , the land looked like this .
and it got worse , not better .
now , all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season , and if it doesn &apos;t , the grassland and the soil begin to die .
so rather than reinvent the wheel , i began studying other professions to see if anybody had .
they put 25,000 sheep in one flock , really mimicking nature now with planned grazing , and they have documented a 50-percent increase in the production of the land in the first year .
that is an astonishing talk , truly an astonishing talk , and i think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way .
that &apos;s the humanitarian mission .
and here &apos;s the same child three weeks post-operation , with the right eye open .
and nobody knows how this integration happens , and that &apos;s the question we asked with project prakash .
doctor : how many things are these ?
as some of you might know , babyies are born pretty much legally blind .
the red dots are the children we have not treated .
that &apos;s all i &apos;d ever known .
you know , he &apos;s thinking , &quot; what am i getting myself into ? &quot;
and i , i mean , was just mortified -- because i was signed up for the 200 , you know , which went off in a half hour .
so , it &apos;s funny -- i &apos;m three inches within the world record -- and kept on from that point , you know , so i &apos;m signed up in the long jump -- signed up ?
and georgetown -- that was great .
ss : why don &apos;t you show them your legs ?
ss : are you a different height ?
for me , while i &apos;m such a serious athlete on the track , i want to be feminine off the track , and i think it &apos;s so important not to be limited in any capacity , whether it &apos;s , you know , your mobility or even fashion .
&quot; no , no , no , no . i &apos;ve got these special feet that need a two-inch heel . i have a three-inch heel .
so that &apos;s a chunk of what we &apos;re looking for .
or about 75,000 jobs .
lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world , except if you &apos;re learning it .
did it answer the question ?
so we better be damn sure -- and by the way , they didn &apos;t even have fun doing it , most of them -- so we better be damn sure that we know why we &apos;re doing that and it has a real purpose .
basics of what ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i think there is one thing that i think very valid here , which is that i think understanding procedures and processes is important .
and very , very simple .
we can engage so many more students with this , and they can have a better time doing it .
i went back to the left , and so slid the chair , blocking my path of travel .
my training had started .
and i don &apos;t know who &apos;s watching who , but i have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me .
and even without sight , i don &apos;t get that in san francisco .
so , in designing a city for the blind , i hope you start to realize that it actually would be a more inclusive , a more equitable , a more just city for all .
so , that was hard .
then i went down and i read several versions , and i wrote down every single law that i could find .
this was one of the huge lessons of the year , is that i almost pretended to be a better person , and i became a little bit of a better person .
how can the bible be so barbaric in some places , and yet so incredibly wise in others ?
if you &apos;re ever in kentucky , there &apos;s , you can see a movie of the flood , and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes .
thank you . bless you , bless you .
and i failed miserably .
the interface is the os .
the luminous room is a system in which it &apos;s considered that input and output spaces are co-located .
and if you introduce tools like this inverse clock , then you can control the sun &apos;s position in the sky .
and that &apos;s all well and good .
and we &apos;ll bring this back here for a second .
and finally , i &apos;d like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery .
ju : no , it has to be for every human being .
john underkoffler : pointing to the future of ui
now what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology .
there are other candidates of course , but lolcats will do as a general case .
now they saw -- and this is what the graph is , these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals -- that there were between six and 10 instances of late pick-ups on average in these 10 daycare centers .
this brings me back to the lolcats and to ushahidi .
but we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value .
and then you worked out your strategy , and you came and fought the next day , and you went back home again .
and so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , ravi dhariwal from pepsi , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
if he had bowled fast , the ball would have gone where it was meant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . and we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game .
this was an india that was adding more mobile phones per month than new zealand &apos;s population twice over .
never would india have thought on this scale before .
i &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because i think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
lalit modi was on the cover of business today .
we all make decisions every day ; we want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic .
it was very easy to remember seeing dogs , not so easy to remember pigs . and each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind , then dogs on leashes are more probable .
the lottery is an excellent example , of course -- an excellent test-case of people &apos;s ability to compute probabilities .
now , estimating odds , as difficult as it may seem , is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate value : trying to say what something is worth , how much we &apos;ll enjoy it , how much pleasure it will give us .
this tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal . in other words , a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal .
but even when we compare with the possible , instead of the past , we still make certain kinds of mistakes .
nonetheless , their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience .
now , you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo .
people are gladly willing to wait : as long as they &apos;re waiting 12 , they might as well wait 13 .
suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us .
we already know , for example , in the united states , more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes -- because they were scared -- and driving on highways , than were killed in 9 / 11 . ok ?
but is there a rational fear that actually , the reason we &apos;re frightened about this is because we think that the big one is to come ?
any animal you see that you &apos;ve seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you &apos;ve never seen before .
i very much resonate with what you &apos;re saying , because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever . do you have any advice ?
that &apos;s the real piero della francesca -- one of the greatest portraits in human history .
and i really struggled with this one .
i remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts -- &quot; if you have to explain it , it ain &apos;t working . &quot;
do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school ? &quot;
but i was absolutely stuck on the idea of &quot; art is &quot; and trying to determine what art was .
in fact , it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless , but as a poison , it was the best money could buy , so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands .
he later wrote , &quot; it &apos;s okay , some of my best friends are naked savages . &quot;
the way that we measured this was by a scale that was constructed by some other psychologists that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations how likely they are to feel disgust .
in another set of studies we actually simply reminded people -- this was at a time when the swine flu was going around -- we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread of the flu that they ought to wash their hands .
but what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man &apos;s life , search , thought , everything -- just in a reduced , small version .
marcus : because i do what i like ?
epuisé -- tired , exhausted , fed up .
how -- and it &apos;s sort of , perhaps romantic , but i think beautiful , because you just need something to hold on to , especially in a society where you feel alienated .
ezra : they give us the special drugs . we call it bubbles .
my story is a little bit complicated .
state your name and age for the commission .
you are not on trial .
filmmaker newton aduaka shows clips from his powerful , lyrical feature film &quot; ezra , &quot; about a child soldier in sierra leone .
this one shows the wind potential all around the united states .
mm : thank you .
a lot of us work for people ; we &apos;re in the hands of other people .
but i just found out the world ain &apos;t going to last that long , this guy was telling us the other day .
he gets up there and then he ... comes back up .
alvaro siza grew up and lived in portugal and is probably considered the portuguese main guy in architecture .
fg : no , it &apos;s near the current campus .
and i think everybody -- i mean that should be a matter of fact , like gravity .
rsw : didn &apos;t get a laugh .
i asked them what kind of building it was .
but let me just say a couple words .
and i did go out , and i did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring , along a roadside .
but we &apos;ve become totally disconnected from them .
and that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned , and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle .
and these are some of the images from that .
so it &apos;s like marrying up all the things that we have and it &apos;s an adaptation of our way of life , full stop .
the kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something , and these are called the villas .
this is the coal supply for the steel factory -- 18 square kilometers .
and that &apos;s a diptych . i do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places .
so a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to china by ships .
one of them i &apos;m starting from almost nothing , but the other one , i wanted to find out what &apos;s going on that &apos;s working right now .
you know , we know that from earlier presentations .
accepting his 2005 prize , photographer edward burtynsky makes a wish : that his images -- stunning landscapes that document humanity &apos;s impact on the world -- help persuade millions to join a global conversation on sustainability .
and what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day ?
so the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don &apos;t work for plastics .
it &apos;s the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the earth .
even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
and finally , i hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to : &quot; if it &apos;s broken , it &apos;s my stuff . &quot;
what i &apos;m most curious about is , how is a species that &apos;s as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time ?
these guys are new world primates , which means they broke off from the human branch about 35 million years ago .
so that &apos;s just what we did .
we just allowed them to pick this up on their own .
she could teach our financial advisers a few things or two .
because it &apos;s yours now ; you can buy whatever you want .
if it comes up tails , you lose nothing , you &apos;re fine , get to keep the whole thing -- or you could play it safe , which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those $ 100 bills , for certain .
the question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases .
now , the monkeys meet two guys who aren &apos;t giving them bonuses ; they &apos;re actually giving them less than they expect .
but of course , you know , the reason you &apos;re laughing is bad for humans too .
we &apos;re so good at overcoming our biological limitations -- you know , i flew over here in an airplane .
i &apos;ve actually seen how people touch the wood , and i think there &apos;s a reason for it .
and although a lot of that is about energy , it &apos;s also so much about carbon .
the next big issue , deforestation .
but that &apos;s the way it should be , nature &apos;s fingerprints in the built environment .
so when we wanted to create our open government policy , what did we do ? we wanted , naturally , to ask public sector employees how we should open up government .
you &apos;ve got 3,000 employees at facebook governing 900 million inhabitants .
february 2012 to june of 2012 , the finalists are announced in the competition .
we &apos;re going to see this evolution really in two phases , i think . the first phase of the open government revolution is delivering better information from the crowd into the center .
beth noveck : demand a more open-source government
now , it was not always wonderful at that table .
i see pictures , and something says , &quot; now , that &apos;s compassion . &quot;
i saw it when the dalai lama came to the riverside church while i was a pastor , and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world .
and whatever else is needed , i will provide it and pay for it when i return . &quot;
and this is why we do it .
it may just be a place for civic commiseration .
and around that space , the ring is actually galleries .
and it has to be free .
and the bubble is 153 ft .
so we didn &apos;t really have that many hurdles , i have to say , with the government and all the authorities .
it &apos;s been a tough journey for me , traveling the world , telling my story in form of a book .
when i went to the training camp i say , &quot; i want to kill as many muslims , and as many arabs , as possible . &quot;
next was i , but jesus heard my cry .
sometime i do wrong in order to make things right .
so one thing i know about music : music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system , your mind , your heart , influence your soul and your spirit , and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing .
i thought i was famous enough that i would raise the money within one month , but i &apos;ve been humbled .
because we have all those old men that are creating wars in africa . they will die soon .
yeah ! i &apos;m gonna get crazy now .
it begins with the murder of an innocent human being , and it &apos;s followed by a trial where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row , and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate court .
why has that happened ?
how do we do that ?
i &apos;ll just mention a few .
but the thing is that for every 15,000 dollars that we spend intervening in the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids in those earlier chapters , we save 80,000 dollars in crime-related costs down the road .
on september 10 , the morning of my seventh birthday , i came downstairs to the kitchen , where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something , and i sort of presented myself to them in the doorway , and they said , &quot; hey , happy birthday ! &quot; and i said , &quot; i &apos;m seven . &quot;
santa would come to our house while we were at nine o &apos;clock high mass on christmas morning , but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss .
my mother had been celebrating my birthday with me , without me .
and i thought , &quot; well , of course i believe in god , but , you know , i don &apos;t like that word , heart , because it anthropomorphizes god , and i don &apos;t like the word , &apos; his , &apos; either , because that sexualizes god . &quot;
well , at this point i just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch .
ok , so , i initially felt really superior to these boys , and smug in my more conventional faith . but then , the more i thought about it , the more i had to be honest with myself .
we &apos;ve used fear , if you like , to grab people &apos;s attention .
he &apos;d be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice , sustainability and people &apos;s well-being .
when it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome , it thinks in terms of efficiency .
they &apos;re latin american .
and if we &apos;re going to do that , we need to pull countries from the bottom , and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph .
i think this is what they want . they want quality of life to keep increasing .
we did a project for the government office of science a couple of years ago , a big program called the foresight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tome .
you can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning .
a group of divinity students at the princeton theological seminary were told that they were going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic .
you can see it at a gross level in the world of dating .
so at one point , my brother-in-law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to , and that is : how could you have done it ?
in other words , at point of purchase , we might be able to make a compassionate choice .
as i sat dumbstruck in my doctor &apos;s office , i heard other words : &quot; cancer , &quot; &quot; stage , &quot; &quot; grade . &quot;
how do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days ?
yes , cancer has just been one page in my life .
why did i do it ?
so yeah , it was difficult to explain , but there was a grassroots movement .
he put up a slide a little bit like this .
so that &apos;s it , really .
let &apos;s start with government data .
audience : raw data now !
bing ! relationship . data .
i &apos;ve only told you a very small number of things there are data in every aspect of our lives , every aspect of work and pleasure , and it &apos;s not just about the number of places where data comes , it &apos;s about connecting it together .
that &apos;s 5,000 fewer kids dying every day , ten times you lot not dead every day , because of all of these partnerships .
could they come together and help the millennium development goals get rebranded into the millennial generation &apos;s goals ?
it &apos;s getting near zero .
jd : absolutely . all right , well i must say , if this conference led in some way to advancing that idea , that &apos;s a huge idea , and if you carry that forward , that is really awesome , so thank you . jd : i &apos;d love your help .
he just started asking , &quot; where did you buy the radio ? how much is it ? &quot;
and then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces .
martin luther king would say , &quot; i imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road , without having their motives called into question . &quot;
this shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch -- do we really see ?
please come for the show . &quot;
because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together , or we can break the sculpture and get the dust , but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe . &quot;
then the second one -- the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence .
because when we see someone walks , we see the footprint .
again , please pick a percentage .
especially because , i suspect , some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims , i think it &apos;s important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney .
the answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15 percent .
if we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one , we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the rio summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on .
and that &apos;s also modernized today , and it &apos;s supporting work for 300 weavers .
getting a little more technical now .
take bp -- they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand , but then one little accident .
so , the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it &apos;s a fundamental law .
luckily , all of this changed a couple of centuries later .
a bat &apos;s a penis , and a nappy dugout is a vulva , or a vagina .
that &apos;s usually a sign to the boy .
&quot; or maybe something a little more adventurous ? &quot;
and we get to decide when we feel satisfied .
&quot; what &apos; tis to love ? &quot; shakespeare said .
you feel intense elation when things are going well ; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly .
and , indeed , these people would say &quot; yes ! &quot;
it keeps bothering you a little bit , like being hungry .
in short , we &apos;re really moving forward to the past .
and i think that the television is like the global campfire .
&quot; oh , well -- men are more adulterous ! &quot;
not at any time on this planet have women been so educated , so interesting , so capable .
i know one girl who &apos;s been on these antidepressants , serotonin-enhancing -- ssri , serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13 .
i don &apos;t know . do you think you &apos;ve got the right person ? &quot;
there &apos;s magic to love !
and we all know that &apos;s from eating too much and not exercising enough , right ?
with that scare , i got busy changing my diet radically , adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking .
consider the following analogy : think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table .
now , we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run , and there &apos;s even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly .
sometimes we have to put cues around people to make it easier , and believe it or not , that can be studied scientifically .
i literally grew up with the ford motor company .
and so even at a young age , that really resonated with me , and the whole notion of environmental preservation , at a very basic level , sunk in with me .
we &apos;re developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word -- economically , socially and environmentally .
but the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care , particularly to people that live in city centers .
but what really inspires me is what &apos;s going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other .
i mean , frankly , i need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue .
so , bringing together the small to help facilitate and create the big , i think , is something that we believe in -- something i believe in , and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at ideo .
so they snapped into action .
and he invented the shipping container .
this idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot .
i mean , shopping bag equals &quot; parking meter out of order . &quot;
and i think that &apos;s what this is very much about .
so we &apos;ve handed out bracelets . small is the new big .
children became more competent , and less helpless .
basically , open your hearts and your minds to the child . &quot;
and they did . stories of change poured in from all over india , from nagaland in the east , to jhunjhunu in the west , from sikkim in the north , to krishnagiri in the south .
are you ready , ladies and gentlemen ? audience : yes !
but what i never said , and what i &apos;m really going to make the point is , that really , green is cool .
this is going back the mid- &apos; 50s , &apos; 60s .
so basically , if you wanted to generalize , you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there , that the energy consumed reduces dramatically .
it has facilities like swimming pools , it has flextime , it has a social heart , a space , you have contact with nature .
so it &apos;s not a kind of sacrifice , quite the reverse .
not going back very far in time , 1990 , that &apos;s our office .
there is an evolution here between the projects , and swiss re again develops that a little bit further -- the project in the city in london .
and how do we make more legible in this growing world , especially in some of the places that i &apos;m talking about -- china , for example , which in the next ten years will create 400 new airports .
that was , of course , by le corbusier , the famous architect .
and enjoying the sun can be in many different ways , of course .
richard kelly saw it as something infinite , something without any focus , something where all details actually dissolve in infinity .
and it is all about this planet .
so that is a really interesting proposition , i think , and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well-being in mind .
can we be more gentle with light ?
so i give you this wonderful , informative image of the sky , ranging from the inner city , where you may see one or two stars and nothing else , all the way to the rural environments , where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars .
now , i was paid in dollars as a consultant , and i looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself : &quot; is there a line in my return , which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible ?
they must not remain anonymous .
it invites tourists to see the shame of our country .
so honey bee network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich .
and she &apos;s so marvelous .
they don &apos;t want second-standard , second-quality outputs .
in other words , solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper , need not be , so-called , jugaad , need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement .
look at what he is doing .
and a professor in the university of massachusetts , in the zoology department , bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy .
remove it , the cart needs one donkey less .
and incentives : not just material , but also non-material incentives .
so , the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal ; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage .
i love them all . i don &apos;t keep any of them in my living room .
65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars .
one of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted , happened out here in california .
we &apos;ve got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense , rich , green-space environment , without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it .
certainly , in the rest of the world , your choice is to devastate the place , turning everything that will burn into heat , or drink the water that &apos;s available .
the idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state .
if we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part , which we know is false , that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars .
they were incredibly effective as enforcers for the gulf cartel , so much so that at some point , they decided to just take over the operations , which is why i ask you to never keep tigers as pets , because they grow up .
they started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the u.s .
thank you .
and that &apos;s one way that we try to time technology trends .
the next phase it hit was displacement .
there will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done , very cheaply , if you want to know . you can learn about your own mosaic .
it &apos;s the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years .
and their response is draconian , and not necessarily the one that &apos;s going to get them out of this .
and on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid .
third , they are often creating markets .
as of today , ide india , amitabha &apos;s organization , has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average , but this didn &apos;t happen overnight .
president obama understands that .
and finally , at the end of the journey , i could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon .
i know it works .
so , besides this freakish thing , this is my science slide . this is math , and this is science ; this is genetics .
this was an illustration about my camp experience when i was 11 years old , and how i went to a ymca camp -- christian camp -- and basically by the end , i had made my friends hate me so much that i hid in a bunk . they couldn &apos;t find me .
how much money does he spend on beer in a year ?
these are the blogs that interest me : the people who just tell stories .
you have your google search where you say , &quot; hey , what is mena trott ? &quot;
and it &apos;s pretty sad , because i only go back five generations , and then it &apos;s it . i don &apos;t even know what happens on my mom &apos;s side , because she &apos;s from cuba and i don &apos;t have that many things .
so , this woman , her name was emma , and she was a blogger on our service , typepad . and she was a beta tester , so she was there right when we opened -- you know , there were 100 people -- and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer .
this is what one of nature &apos;s finest machines .
and if it &apos;s tunas you don &apos;t care about , perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks , sharks , marlin , albatross .
i have the privilege of being a partner with the monterey bay aquarium .
we &apos;ve actually tagged 1,100 tunas .
we &apos;re going to do something that in recent years we &apos;ve started : take a mucus sample .
the center of the atlantic where the mixing is , i could imagine a policy that lets canada and america fish , because they manage their fisheries well , they &apos;re doing a good job .
they get returned , and when they get returned , here on a nasa numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor , returning to the western pacific .
we did this with the great turtle race -- tagged turtles , brought in four million hits .
tuna are ocean athletes -- fast , far-ranging predators whose habits we &apos;re just beginning to understand . marine biologist barbara block fits tuna with tracking tags that record unprecedented amounts of data about these gorgeous , threatened fish and the ocean habitats they move through .
this was in tampa , florida , so i was like , &quot; winter clothes that i have no use for in florida .
so they &apos;re looking at me really odd .
so in the process , i start thinking , well what else might they know about me ?
now if you go to my bank records , it &apos;ll actually show something from there , so you know that , on may 9th , that i bought $ 14.79 in fuel from safeway vallejo .
these are all tacos eaten in mexico city near a train station on july fifth to july sixth .
because it just wouldn &apos;t work if everybody was sharing everything .
he : almost none .
now , as many of you know , airbnb is a peer-to-peer marketplace that matches people who have space to rent with people who are looking for a place to stay in over 192 countries .
it &apos;s about empowering people to make meaningful connections , connections that are enabling us to rediscover a humanness that we &apos;ve lost somewhere along the way , by engaging in marketplaces like airbnb , like kickstarter , like etsy , that are built on personal relationships versus empty transactions .
now the tasks being posted are things that you might expect , like help with household chores or doing some supermarket runs .
well , this isn &apos;t anything new . just think of power sellers on ebay or star ratings on amazon .
i envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you , when , where and why , your reliability on taskrabbit , your cleanliness as a guest on airbnb , the knowledge that you display on quora or &#91; unclear &#93; , they &apos;ll all live together in one place , and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard that will paint a picture of your reputation capital .
but the bigger principle of what &apos;s happening behind stack overflow , i think , is incredibly exciting .
and it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all .
the more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
we did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a separate test bed , we repeated it all on the 50 american states -- asking just the same question : do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures ?
again , quite big differences .
it starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax .
and of course , those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society .
correlation in itself doesn &apos;t prove causality .
despite the advanced technology , it &apos;s not reaching the people who need it most .
how do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives ?
so i wanted to show you some of the iterations we did between the first version , the jaipur knee , so this is it right here .
we have fit over 5,000 amputees , and one of the big indicators we &apos;re looking at , of course , is , does it improve lives ?
for the most part , everyone was just trying to survive .
so none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years .
the acid will ruin the gold plating .
this is one through 20 . next , &quot; they just give you as many o &apos;s as there are pages .
no problem .
and when you &apos;re happy -- what we call positive valence -- you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes , which makes you a breadth-first problem solver : you &apos;re more susceptible to interruption ; you do out-of-the-box thinking .
it &apos;s all about the visceral experience .
and when the tea is ready , or almost ready , you tilt it .
but that &apos;s reflective design as well .
of course , remoteness in its normal sense , which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center , you get to remoter areas .
the teachers always say , well , it &apos;s fine , but it &apos;s too expensive for what it does .
they cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall -- and put a pretty powerful pc into that hole , sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end , a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall , put it on high-speed internet , put the internet explorer there , put it on altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there .
people said , you know , you really ought to have this in indian languages .
i also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors , and i was using regular , normal pcs , so i needed different climates , for which india is also great , because we have very cold , very hot , and so on .
if you test them , all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them .
but at this point in time , as far as science goes , it &apos;s self-organization .
it &apos;s about death .
that year , 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat , and 20 of us succeeded .
i negotiated for my country the resolution in the security council of the 12th of september 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before , which were , of course , deeply present to us actually living in new york at the time .
but anyway , i gave that testimony , and that presented me with a crisis .
and i gave it up .
why don &apos;t you advise their government on their diplomacy ? &quot;
and it turned out he worked for an innovation company called ? what if ! , which some of you have probably heard of .
if they can &apos;t do it , who &apos;s left to deal with it ?
you can actually incorporate these people &apos;s views into your decisions , which means your decisions will be more effective and durable . &quot;
carne ross : an independent diplomat
and you say , &quot; hey , could you bring the skim milk ? &quot;
so it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be .
now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal kingdom , including humans , have four basic primal instincts .
and on a factual basis , over 80 percent of the u.s. &apos; s most popular shows are exported around the world .
but in this case , we have comfort -- the bubble in red -- social commentary and irreverence in blue and green .
it can change us ?
we had 9 / 11 .
so to you all , the women of tedwomen , the men of tedwomen , the global audiences of tedwomen , thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television .
now , the story that i start telling my kids , it starts out like a horror story .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies , the babies also have the virus dna in them .
the way this showed up in the textbook , it looked like this : &quot; bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium . &quot;
but just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across .
thank you .
one of the most exciting to me is this young man , stephen bradley , had an encounter , he thought , with jesus in 1820 .
gray was a soldier in the american army in world war ii .
durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of e pluribus unum , of making a group out of individuals .
in other words , charles darwin believed in group selection .
but suppose then that one of them mutates .
it happened again about 120 or a 140 million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple , primitive nests , or hives .
if it is an adaptation , then we evolved to be religious .
they all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into .
hemingway had his writing space .
on the inside it &apos;s a recreation of a 16th century japanese tea house .
i had requested slides , kind of adamantly , up till the -- pretty much , last few days , but was denied access to a slide projector .
the only thing that &apos;s different is the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece -- and , again , which is the psycho-killer here ?
i think it &apos;s not the only ingredient in design , but possibly the most important .
but i decided i liked this contents page -- i liked the way it looks -- so i kept it .
and then the tiny line of copy says , if you want to see this entire sequence -- how this whole ride was -- go to the website .
i found out that &apos;s very true , working on this campaign worldwide .
and i was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books .
this was what they found on their car .
i have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for hercles , and you get charged by this thing and you go , oh , please be hercles ; please be the friendly one .
and i &apos;ve since then tried to keep technology at arm &apos;s length in many ways , so it doesn &apos;t master my life .
and i &apos;m applying a similar trick to say , what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology ? what does technology want ?
but what i like about this is it shows that every living organism on earth today is equally evolved .
this is all the contents of a japanese home .
in fact , this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that i began to think about what happens with old technology .
they &apos;re actually changing the way in which ideas are generated .
and i think it &apos;s really important . because if you can imagine mozart before the technology of the piano was invented -- what a loss to society there would be .
thank you .
now , the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at , but they didn &apos;t really interact with people .
and what i learned in school though was really beneficial .
so we created a way to find out , and i got my first look at that famous beak in action .
and as these tectonic plates are spreading apart , magma , lava is coming up and filling those gaps , and you &apos;re looking land -- new land -- being created right before your eyes .
and there &apos;s a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed .
i think margaret mead said it best .
and do that , and spread the word .
i drew , and i drew , and since i knew that humor was acceptable in my family , i could draw , do what i wanted to do , and not have to perform , not have to speak -- i was very shy -- and i could still get approval .
it didn &apos;t work .
liza donnelly : drawing on humor for change
and scientific theory means quantifiable -- relying on underlying generic principles that can be made into a predictive framework .
and you see , you &apos;re very familiar with this .
now any physiological variable you can think of , any life history event you can think of , if you plot it this way , looks like this .
but here &apos;s what &apos;s surprising .
this 15 percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet -- japan , chile , portugal , scotland , doesn &apos;t matter .
so lastly , i &apos;m going to finish up in this last minute or two asking about companies .
physicist geoffrey west has found that simple , mathematical laws govern the properties of cities -- that wealth , crime rate , walking speed and many other aspects of a city can be deduced from a single number : the city &apos;s population . in this mind-bending talk from tedglobal he shows how it works and how similar laws hold for organisms and corporations .
they checked schedules . they were meeting with secretaries .
i then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life , or in their own story , or in their own world , that they could identify that had done a similar thing .
they were a little uncomfortable with it , because we &apos;d never done this before , and they didn &apos;t know exactly how to do it .
this is one of my favorite photos , because this was taken on tuesday , when i asked the students to go to the polls .
regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago .
how can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
so today &apos;s reality is that if we get sick , the message is we will treat your symptoms , and you need to adjust to a new way of life .
secondly , we can use materials .
and that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn &apos;t have before .
he chills the dish , it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish .
this is the work of kacey marra from pittsburgh , along with a number of colleagues around the world .
so my 18 minutes is up .
and i &apos;m going to finish up with a quote , maybe a little cheap shot , at the director of the nih , who &apos;s a very charming man .
and so i &apos;ve brought a couple of them with me .
there are so many celebrities running around here .
it &apos;s like a rainbow .
actually , you could say i grew up in the capital of dominican republic , otherwise known as washington heights in new york city .
so , i know , see , like the name is like a little bit long , but with the war on terror and everything , the dean of student activities has asked us to stop saying da bomb and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea , whatever .
you know , she was very chic , but she was very filled with ennui , you know .
my name is pauline ning , and first i want to tell you that i &apos;m -- of course i am a member of the chinese community in new york .
so , i accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend .
and i see that a few of them did make it here to the conference .
and i know i &apos;ve performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere , but this is honestly one of the best audiences i &apos;ve ever experienced .
and someone , at some point , came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldn &apos;t make a difference in the world .
but right after that , pierre -- in &apos; 96 , pierre and i left our full-time jobs to build ebay as a company . and the rest of that story , you know .
and a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that i find really is powerful .
and it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy .
and for participant , this is just the start .
jeff skoll : my journey into movies that matter
and like i tell my family , and my wife reminds me every time , &quot; you &apos;re risking your life , you know , every time you go to that country . &quot;
and believe me , these are current pictures .
equipment that &apos;s obsolete , equipment that doesn &apos;t quite work , or it works and you can &apos;t fix it . and there &apos;s nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on .
this is what i mean about appropriate technology .
if you take nitrogen out , what &apos;s left ? oxygen , pretty much .
you can see the bars of the window there .
and yes , my sing campaign has supported treatment action campaign in the way that i have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
it &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the aids pandemic .
annie lennox : why i am an hiv / aids activist
in a pre-internet world , sovereignty over our physical freedoms , or lack thereof , was controlled almost entirely by nation-states .
the reality is that even in democratic societies today , we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks .
of course , it &apos;s going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is .
but it &apos;s going to require innovation that &apos;s not only going to need to focus on politics , on geopolitics , but it &apos;s also going to need to deal with questions consumer choice and even software design and engineering .
and amongst the chaos , amidst the euphoria , it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before 1989 , in eastern europe , continued to do so after the revolutions there .
but above all else , by talking to the gangsters themselves .
and it is this western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime .
and a lot of licit banks were also happy to accept deposits from very dubious sources without questions being asked .
when that happens , it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the west .
i was very fortunate when the iloveyou virus came out , because the first person i received it from was an ex-girlfriend of mine .
well , this is 2009 .
and we got so overheated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away .
well , we know the answer because thomas s. kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in 1962 .
and at that time , it became set in stone : the aquatic theory should be dumped with the ufos and the yetis , as part of the lunatic fringe of science .
but you can say this : all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs , if they want to , for a short time .
i am trying to suggest that , for 40-odd years , this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe , and it is not lunatic fringe .
sir david attenborough , he &apos;s come over .
i can tell you that in three words .
it &apos;s such a large conference .
are you ? oh , yeah . so what are you , like , a thousand , two thousand , somewhere in there ? huh ? oh ?
and , finally , you know , become freelance .
voice : hey , moron , get off the stage .
do you have a preference ? good choice .
i mean this is incredible . this is an 11-year-old girl -- drew this and submitted it . it &apos;s just gorgeous .
what we need to understand is : what drives the political creature ?
so , how are you going to write your letter ?
because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature : that you have influence in a large sphere , and that my preservation depends on you .
i can guarantee , everyone in this room , all of you over there , the people in the cushy seats , the people up top with the laptops -- we all have bodies .
and it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards .
they &apos;re both shrinking and retreating -- and some of them have disappeared altogether .
kate hartman : the art of wearable communication
now then we get the great depression and world war ii .
they &apos;re always all siblings who are children of a single queen , so they &apos;re all in the same boat .
this was a golden age of bipartisanship , at least in terms of the parties &apos; ability to work together and solve grand national problems .
it drifts downwards very slightly , but now look what happens under george w. bush and obama .
but the third class of reforms is that we &apos;ve got to change the nature of social relationships in congress .
some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts .
so once again , we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing .
now this is a social disaster , and liberals are very concerned about this .
and this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way .
so what we &apos;re trying to do is , we &apos;re trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture , which contrast the current , victorian , top-down methods which impose structure upon matter .
we &apos;re looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this .
thank you .
time is . time has come . &apos; &apos; white is leaving , &apos; steve said somberly .
loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don &apos;t make sense , and if the words get jumbled up enough , it &apos;s called &quot; word salad . &quot;
&apos;i think someone &apos;s infiltrated my copies of the cases , &apos; i said .
every week in the united states , it &apos;s been estimated that one to three people die in restraints .
kaplan would later describe me as &apos; writhing in agony . &apos; even in this state , what he accurately described as acutely and forwardly psychotic , i refused to take more medication .
second , i have many close family members and friends who know me and know my illness .
so would i take the pill ? in an instant .
our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving .
sebastian thrun helped build google &apos;s amazing driverless car , powered by a very personal quest to save lives and reduce traffic accidents . jawdropping video shows the darpa challenge-winning car motoring through busy city traffic with no one behind the wheel , and dramatic test drive footage from ted2011 demonstrates how fast the thing can really go .
oddly , a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream , and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers .
so what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem ?
this guy &apos;s measuring the water that this leaves in the stream .
they &apos;re completely flat , and they &apos;re basically cardboard characters .
so all of that being said , i still really appreciate those characters in movies and articles like that on our site , that aren &apos;t just about being totally powerful , maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those .
compassion is fun .
the first example is the largest annual community event -- where googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities -- was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official , because it just became too big .
so what has this got to do with business leadership ?
or , how can you further serve the greater good ?
so using the supercharged attention from step one , we create a high-resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes .
he was not a political prisoner .
she said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
i was recently in egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . the police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . they were torturing everybody all the time . &quot;
this is fantastic . &quot; and he said to me , &quot; well , do you have money ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot; and he said , &quot; that &apos;s okay , we can still figure it out . &quot;
so i thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
the exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...
they think of somebody choosing fabrics .
and other examples : this was marti guixe about working on the go , and hella jongerius , my favorite , about how to work at home .
this is a beautiful project by ralph borland , who &apos;s south african .
this is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically .
but design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales , and therefore , really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful .
the bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast .
and i sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him , saying , you know , who do you think you are ?
and that kept him going .
he was like , i try and i make .
you know , it &apos;s not enough to complain . we need to act .
i &apos;ve also set up a project in kenya , and what we do is we track the performance of kenyan mps .
and i &apos;d ask all of you , when you leave here , please just share , and keep the ideas that you &apos;ve gotten out of here going , because it can make a difference .
he called me to his office and said , &quot; what do you want to do when you grow up ? &quot;
that you can grow up , you know , not so good circumstances , and you can move .
i didn &apos;t want to pity myself , nor to be pitied , and i thought by organizing such a marathon , i &apos;ll be able to pay back to my community , build bridges with the outside world , and invite runners to come to lebanon and run under the umbrella of peace .
but we did have a marathon .
it is more of a marathon .
what was really shocking for me was that he said that this is entirely due to undiagnosed anemia .
we knew it had to be these three things that the machine had to have .
and by the time i &apos;m done , in 2020 , when the who publishes the data again , this is going to be the map of anemia .
this led to open-heart surgery . this is the actual real email from my doctor right there .
so these are my daughters .
there was no water . there was no energy , no oil , no cars , none of that .
so that is the chapter two : the oil era .
how could we survive that ?
this is the situation in qatar , for those who don &apos;t know .
without it we can &apos;t do anything .
it helped gandhi kick the brits from india .
well , the news here is that your skills &#91; that you &#93; bring in the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions , namely skills of unity , planning , and maintaining nonviolent discipline .
it &apos;s only 200 of us in this room .
what will they do ? arrest us ? we are nowhere to be seen .
are they going to become the world wave ?
and she said , &quot; i saw your talk live-streamed .
and then i looked at her and i said something that at the time felt a little dramatic , but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic .
there &apos;s three big answers .
and she looks back and does this , &quot; i know . &quot;
you can &apos;t fix that problem without addressing shame , because when they teach those folks how to suture , they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful .
and it goes like this : &quot; it is not the critic who counts .
how many of you would be willing to say that ?
and it &apos;s a straight-jacket .
the top answers in this country : nice , thin , modest and use all available resources for appearance .
so what would be better &#91; than &#93; to use the herring gull , in its freedom , circling and swooping over the sea , and &#91; to &#93; use this as a role model ?
also , we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency .
if we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses , then almost one in five indians will require eye care , a staggering 200 million people .
they feel they can train people all over the world , irrespective of different religions , cultures , all those things , to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places .
the effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served , which is over 50,000 people .
the result has been , over the years , the expenditure has increased with volumes .
you take dentistry , hearing aid , maternity and so on .
as humans , we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy .
you can &apos;t see it , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
when i started using the wheelchair , it was a tremendous new freedom .
so to give you an idea of what that &apos;s like , i &apos;d like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle , and show you what an amazing journey it &apos;s taken me on .
she pointed out that the &quot; control men &quot; -- as she called them -- who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like ddt , were only trying to kill the little stuff , the insects , not the birds .
so rather than asking , as precaution would demand , what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe , we ask bizarre questions like this : &quot; what is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions ?
so it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides -- for society at least .
and it &apos;s also the story of modern capitalism , because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system , one that cannot survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers .
it &apos;s worth taking a moment to understand this practice , because i believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we &apos;re on like little else .
the problem is that our master-narrative has an answer for that too .
thank you .
bf : oh yeah , it does .
bf : yeah . and so we &apos;ve actually found a way to incorporate richard in this .
ok , hold on .
and if that wasn &apos;t enough , and judging by your response , it &apos;s not ...
or a virgin for a sacrifice ?
bf : they &apos;re a good crew ! whoa !
we &apos;re going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition .
dh : wow ! what a great trick , barry !
bf : seven-club juggling .
i &apos;ll spend a fortune on it . i &apos;ve got a better idea .
there &apos;s this incredible complexity in the cpu , and this incredible regularity in the memory .
now , some people call her the first programmer .
in fact , it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers , only really slowly .
i have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane .
the thickness of the arctic decreased more than 40 percent since 1960 .
we have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities .
just as that woman tried to kiss my feet when we were taking her sons .
how can we make it all by ourselves ?
in less than 50 years we &apos;ve altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind .
let me tell you something .
it costs about a dollar for each base -- a very slow way of doing it .
two years later , she comes back with stage three c ovarian cancer .
guys , this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing .
this is a typewriter , a staple of every desktop for decades .
and it looks really good .
and so i urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that &apos;s happening all around you .
our standard see-through patient .
it may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live-saving bone marrow donors .
and it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities , just like a coral .
we can &apos;t predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision .
the main purpose of the large hadron collider is to see this higgs particle , and we &apos;re almost certain it will .
whenever particles interact , nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions .
we want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone , and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada .
one small part of this e8 shape can be used to describe the curved space-time of einstein &apos;s general relativity , explaining gravity .
if the lhc finds new particles , but they don &apos;t fit this pattern -- well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this e8 theory .
i &apos;ve chosen a very unusual life .
and , as i said , the way the shape twists -- the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface -- is what the elementary particles are , themselves .
and therefore , perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient , ancient past .
chimpanzees , i believe , more than any other living creature , have helped us to understand that , after all , there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom .
we provide information about family planning and about hiv / aids .
as i began traveling around africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests , i realized more and more how so many of africa &apos;s problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation .
well , do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain , the kind of brain that the ted technologies exemplify , and the human heart ? talking about it in the non-scientific term , in terms of love and compassion . is there some disconnect ?
just picking one or two of the projects right here in africa that the roots and shoots groups are doing , one or two projects only -- in tanzania , in uganda , kenya , south africa , congo-brazzaville , sierra leone , cameroon and other groups . and as i say , it &apos;s in 97 countries around the world .
how many of us have children or grandchildren , nieces , nephews ?
people like this are so inspirational .
i then , in the last few years , learned about the pacific garbage patch and the gyre .
and if you really look into it , particularly when it comes to plastic bottles , most of it is only down-cycled , or incinerated , or shipped to china .
and so my research group at the media lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way , without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior .
so this particular choice here is a particularly good choice , given his personal criteria .
phyllis rodriguez : we are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship .
and i saw phyllis , and i watched her .
this is why i &apos;m here in front of you .
you have to fight against violence .
i , like most of you , was sitting down , the day after christmas in 2004 , when i was watching the devastating news of the asian tsunami as it rolled in , playing out on tv .
i spent all the time setting this up , so i guess i should .
okay . there we go .
and people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water .
so with just eight billion dollars , we can hit the millennium goal &apos;s target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water .
and the first of these , the first two of these , is about a shift in power .
if we didn &apos;t have the u.n. , we &apos;d have to invent it .
in fact , what &apos;s now emerging is the much more normal case of history .
my guess is that we &apos;re reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years -- i say 400 years because it &apos;s the end of the ottoman empire -- of the hegemony of western power , western institutions and western values .
today in our modern world , because of the internet , because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here , everything is connected to everything .
by the way , don &apos;t ask me about ashdown &apos;s first law and second law because i haven &apos;t invented those yet ; it always sounds better if there &apos;s a third law , doesn &apos;t it ?
for us , i think , part of the equation for our survival .
and the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be 100 .
and every time they turn themselves over there is some damage . and that damage builds up .
it &apos;s called cannonau .
once again , a plant-based diet , full of vegetables with lots of color in them .
and then one day , boom , we retire .
they celebrate their sabbath from sunset on friday till sunset on saturday .
ellsworth whareham is 97 years old .
and the first one , and i &apos;m about to utter a heresy here , none of them exercise , at least the way we think of exercise .
doesn &apos;t mean they don &apos;t eat meat , but lots of beans and nuts .
but now we have these amazing , futuristic composites -- plastics that change shape , paints that conduct electricity , pigments that change color , fabrics that light up .
but why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of ?
but paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics .
i slammed on the brakes .
if that guy &apos;s going down to zero , i &apos;ll know .
what happens if two cars share that data , if they talk to each other ?
i believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs .
it took us 11 years to become operational .
once he was there , &#91; we &#93; let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like .
if you look at the math , e = mc squared , if you look at the cosmological constant , where there &apos;s an anthropic ideal , where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe -- these are things that are really difficult to understand .
but these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing , and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other .
and there were a lot of things that i wanted to feel and deal with while i was doing that .
and i refused to give them up , so i stayed in the van .
an essay i &apos;d written about my father , the year before he died , was in tim &apos;s new book .
and i &apos;m not here to be the poster girl for the homeless .
we went to the nurses and the midwives , who were also women , and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill .
so we went to the teachers .
and this is on the fourth of july .
so i thought , &quot; well , if you can &apos;t go to the government , go to the military . &quot;
and we said , &quot; everyone needs to be involved . &quot;
and then this is the picture i mentioned to you -- the weapon of mass protection .
it &apos;s not a free gift .
and it &apos;s a center , a focal point for economic and social development .
so meet romo .
and in the same way that you scroll through content on an ipad , i can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device .
and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser , which is what you see romo doing on the left .
in the last 20 years i have published a few books , but i have lived in anonymity until february of 2006 , when i carried the olympic flag in the winter olympics in italy .
heart is what drives us and determines our fate .
so , there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth .
she names the twins after the camp &apos;s commanders to gain their favor , and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them .
it has evolved . if you don &apos;t like the term , change it , for goddess &apos; sake .
the day before , her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him .
does it make sense to participate in the existing world order ?
not better , but to make it good .
that &apos;s better . and of course , in principle , you could do three , four or more , but it starts to get very difficult .
so they had people play this game while they were being scanned in an fmri , and two conditions : in some trials , they &apos;re told you &apos;re playing another person who &apos;s playing right now and we &apos;re going to match up your behavior at the end and pay you if you win .
so this is like a management-labor negotiation in which the workers don &apos;t know how much profits the privately held company has , right , and they want to maybe hold out for more money , but the company might want to create the impression that there &apos;s very little to split : &quot; i &apos;m giving you the most that i can . &quot;
that is , the informed brain seems to be deciding , &quot; we &apos;re probably not going to make a deal here . &quot;
right ? who thinks you could beat the chimps ?
they &apos;re actually closer than any species we &apos;ve observed .
so meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand .
this is no accident , because agriculture and cities are bound together . they need each other .
and the same of course was true for fish .
they &apos;re being slaughtered out of sight and mind , somewhere in the countryside .
by making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place , they &apos;ve actually distanced us from our most important relationship , which is that of us and nature .
but anyway , this is -- it &apos;s food at the center of life , at the center of family life , being celebrated , being enjoyed , people taking time for it .
we &apos;re going to see them more like this , as part of the productive , organic framework of which they are inevitably a part , symbiotically connected .
look into your own heart , discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse , under any circumstance whatsoever , to inflict that pain on anybody else .
and we need to revive that spirit .
because we can change the world , we have the ability .
so in the current state of manufacturing , we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years &#91; of assembly time &#93; , 500,000 to a million parts , fairly complex , new , exciting technologies in steel , concrete , glass .
i mean , thousands of dollars , lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot .
it &apos;s directly embedded ; there &apos;s no external instructions .
recently i visited beloit , wisconsin .
and beijerinck &apos;s discovery , this was not something that occurred 500 years ago .
that as we explore these strings of a &apos;s , t &apos;s , c &apos;s and g &apos;s , we may uncover a completely new class of life that , like beijerinck , will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology .
now the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we &apos;re at a very un-typical place , uniquely suited and so on , and the second one is saying that we &apos;re at a typical place .
and that is how un-typical this place is .
we also need energy to make the computer , and most important , to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover .
so we &apos;re not in a uniquely hospitable place .
but no precautions , and no precautionary principle , can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee .
so here is the puzzle .
in particular check out asia .
but then in the late &apos; 70s something changed .
so the proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city .
this model is all about choices , both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places .
now , if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites , but dozens -- cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions , perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century -- is there enough land for them ?
you could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police , the courts , but the school system and the health care system too , which make this a more attractive place to live , makes this a place where people have higher incomes -- which , incidentally , makes the land more valuable .
we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours .
just on the data collection side , just where we are through the galapagos , we &apos;re finding that almost every 200 miles , we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean .
so we started doing transposon mutagenesis .
and there &apos;s only two countries , the u.s. and the former soviet union , that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents .
also , there &apos;s numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane .
philip zimbardo : let &apos;s tune into the conversation of the principals in adam &apos;s temptation .
and you do it automatically and non-consciously .
so , very quickly , what is the optimal time profile ?
we are drowning in news .
as we heard yesterday , there &apos;s over a billion people hungry .
and here &apos;s a beautiful picture of the andromeda nebula , which is our closest , largest spiral galaxy to the milky way .
it can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills , down into the lowlands . so stop and think for a minute .
it is so significant that , in my mind , this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the u.s. and europe , and sadly , that wasn &apos;t the case .
and obviously , it landed in one of these flat , dark regions and it didn &apos;t sink out of sight . so it wasn &apos;t fluid that we landed in .
that &apos;s as bizarre as finding that the antarctic on the earth is hotter than the tropics .
for the last 8 years , i have dedicated my life to documenting the work of israelis and palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means .
fatah party member : we must empty our minds of traditional thinking .
violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common ; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause .
i believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don &apos;t pay attention to these efforts , they are invisible , and it &apos;s as if they never happened .
in the last year alone , thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information , and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable .
and scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food .
so that &apos;s one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it &apos;s exploring around .
so back to homer .
and yet , they &apos;re just a computer company .
but very , very few people or organizations know why they do what they do .
we believe in thinking differently .
people don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it .
but if you don &apos;t know why you do what you do , and people respond to why you do what you do , then how will you ever get people to vote for you , or buy something from you , or , more importantly , be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do .
samuel pierpont langley was different .
well , you can trip over 10 percent of the customers .
they were extremely well-funded .
in fact , some of his ideas were bad .
we follow those who lead , not for them , but for ourselves .
and over the course of six months , i would corner them in the hallway and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question : &quot; if you had unlimited resources , what &apos;s the one thing you would give your patients ? &quot;
so when i got this email from dr. geiger , i knew i was supposed to be proud to be part of this history .
we started with the prescription pad -- a very ordinary piece of paper -- and we asked , not what do patients need to get healthy -- antibiotics , an inhaler , medication -- but what do patients need to be healthy , to not get sick in the first place ?
but mostly we all just sit there forever , waiting .
health leads too recruits competitively , trains intensively , coaches professionally , demands significant time , builds a cohesive team and measures results -- a kind of teach for america for healthcare .
and i have to say , i was like &quot; whoa .
it &apos;s the bridge over the drina river , the subject of a novel by ivo andrić , and it talks about how , in that very troubled part of europe and the balkans , over time there &apos;s been enormous building of walls .
so this cyber sea , which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness , is very much under threat as well .
we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun .
they are hospital ships .
purple are tweets . green are geolocation .
you don &apos;t have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks .
you can violate your expectations about experience . here is an outside water fountain that i created with some friends of mine , but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate . this is something we &apos;re building for , you know , amusement parks and that kind of stuff .
they &apos;re looking out two directions at once . you have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller . and that &apos;s something for you to think about , all right ? so you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here . does everyone see that ? which is impossible . you can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once . now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape ? they are .
and they go over all this -- i &apos;m going to try to be a little more serious this year in showing you how things really changed .
and here , children don &apos;t live longer .
i think we have to go , there -- we have 2001 , or 2002 -- the united states has the same health as chile .
sweden was like sierra leone today .
this is 1962 , and united states was emitting 16 tons per person .
and how do they live ?
and they are very , very eagerly interested to get advice , and that &apos;s to survive in poverty .
i have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine .
it was the government that made law function finally .
and i &apos;ve shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible .
this is gobbledygook for if the united states fights somebody we &apos;re going to be huge .
we can run the score up against anybody , and then get our asses kicked in the second half -- what they call fourth generation warfare .
it &apos;s your oil , not ours . &quot;
it &apos;s transparent . a certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non-zero outcome .
and if that doesn &apos;t work we scream , &quot; he &apos;s got a gun ! &quot;
you will get this model .
they spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world what i call the core and the gap .
everybody &apos;s got an opinion .
this is the hobbesian force .
it &apos;s everything the man &apos;s military hates .
i don &apos;t want my marines handing out aid .
this is not about money .
and we &apos;ve accomplished close to zip .
and it &apos;s this stuff in the middle here , which is what you do if you don &apos;t stop the emissions quickly enough .
and one other thing : it &apos;s fast .
not as something that was foolproof , but as an idea to think about .
that &apos;s called the photophoretic force .
the scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece , in their labs .
we have all sorts of other problems , like ocean acidification that come from co2 in the atmosphere , anyway .
not just at how you would do it better , but also what all the risks and downsides of it are .
there &apos;s a flying turkey under a tree .
cuttlefish . i love cuttlefish . this is a giant australian cuttlefish .
just an amazing animal , it can change color and texture to match the surroundings . watch him blend right into this algae .
we like the ups and downs of life .
i used to be a fan of bach . i used to play it on the guitar , you know .
even joy -- that can be the spring of happiness .
and also , they are detrimental to others &apos; happiness .
so , there are natural antidotes to emotions that are destructive to our inner well-being .
now , recently , it has been found that it can change a lot .
if you see a comic movie , you go off to the left side .
this lady with bone tb , left alone in a tent , is going to die with her only daughter .
the public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in america because we don &apos;t have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures .
it has something that is terribly important -- it has what &apos;s called an active and permeable membrane around the edge .
you can see exactly what went on , three o &apos;clock in the morning at the design meeting .
i call them &quot; nature band-aids &quot; because there &apos;s a general idea in america that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature .
i don &apos;t have any eyes on the side of my head . i can &apos;t see . &quot;
forget it . it &apos;s not going to happen .
and america &apos;s not prepared .
when you go on a thing like this , we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months , with a team as small as 20 or 30 , to as big as 150 .
next year i &apos;ll be leading an international team to j2 .
this gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper , and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave , and it happened to be underwater in wakulla springs .
one is , how do you do science autonomy underground ?
and i hope you &apos;ll bear with me and have some faith that there &apos;s credibility behind what we &apos;re going to say here .
and the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon .
but if you send a mining team there , without the return propellant , first -- did any of you guys hear the story of cortez ?
bill stone : exploring deep caves
and if i see -- you know , if i fly on somebody else &apos;s airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one , which it wasn &apos;t , 21 years ago , then i &apos;d think , well , you know , maybe i can create the kind of airline that i &apos;d like to fly on .
i mean , couldn &apos;t you have used the virgin brand for that as well ?
ok .
so that &apos;s the bert rutan designed spaceship ?
but the ends of all those balloon trips were , you know -- something seemed to go wrong every time , and on that particular occasion , the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped , and left me holding on for dear life .
rb : in fact , i think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying , you know , come on , richard , there are better ways of crossing the atlantic .
rb : she was , you know , she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age .
and so i rang up nottingham university , and i asked to talk to the professor of linguistics .
what is that ?
but we &apos;re also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics , so that people pay for some other aspects .
